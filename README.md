# Zhian Kamvar's Ph. D. Thesis

### Title to be determined


This is utilizing the beavtex.cls from the [Overleaf template][1]. For 
management of the chapters and content, I am utilizing the flow presented in
the [EBI-predocs/latex-thesis github site.][2]

To build the thesis, type:

```
make
```

Don't forget to clean up after yourself, though:

```
make clean
```

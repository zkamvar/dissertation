## Abstract

Sudden oak death caused by the oomycete *Phytophthora ramorum* was first
discovered in California toward the end of the 20th century and subsequently
emerged on tanoak forests in Oregon before its first detection in 2001 by aerial
surveys. The Oregon Department of Forestry has since monitored the epidemic and
sampled symptomatic tanoak trees from 2001 to the present. Populations sampled
over this period were genotyped using microsatellites and studied to infer the
population genetic history. To date, only the NA1 clonal lineage is established
in this region, although three lineages exist on the North American west coast.
The original introduction into the Joe Hall area eventually spread to several
regions: mostly north but also east and southwest. A new introduction into
Hunter Creek appears to correspond to a second introduction not clustering with
the early introduction. Our data are best explained by both introductions
originating from nursery populations in California or Oregon and resulting from
two distinct introduction events. Continued vigilance and eradication of nursery
populations of *P. ramorum* are important to avoid further emergence and
potential introduction of other clonal lineages.

## Introduction

Sudden oak death (SOD) emerged as a severe epidemic disease on coast live oak
(*Quercus agrifolia*) and tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*) in California
in the mid 1990s and reemerged shortly thereafter on tanoak in Oregon in the
early 2000s [@hansen2008epidemiology; @rizzo2005phytophthora;
@grunwald2008phytophthora;
@everhart2014phytophthora]. SOD is caused by *Phytophthora ramorum* Werres, De
Cock & Man in't Veld, and is considered to be one of the top two oomycete
pathogens based on its scientific and economic importance [@kamoun2014top;
@werres2001phytophthora]. The Oregon epidemic was first detected during aerial
surveys in 2001 on tanoak but likely derived from initial introductions in the
late 1990s. The Oregon Department of Forestry has since monitored the epidemic
and sampled symptomatic tanoaks since 2001 [@hansen2008epidemiology]. Strains
sampled from infected sites in forest or nursery environments have been
genotyped in several labs using a range of microsatellite loci
[@grunwald2009standardizing; @ivors2006microsatellite; @prospero2004isolation;
@prospero2007population; @prospero2009migration].

*P. ramorum* has emerged repeatedly around the world as 4 distinct clonal
lineages found in North America (lineages NA1, NA2, and EU1) and Europe (EU1 and
EU2) [@grunwald2012emergence; @ivors2006microsatellite;
@vanpoucke2012discovery]. The lineages have been named by the continent on which
they first appeared, i.e. North America (= NA) or Europe (= EU) and are numbered
in order of discovery [@grunwald2009standardizing]. The NA1 clonal lineage was
first discovered in California causing SOD on tanoak and coast live oak and is
the one currently found in Curry County, Oregon, USA
[@mascheretti2008reconstruction]. The EU1 and NA2 populations were discovered
later in nursery environments and are currently only found in California,
Oregon, Washington and British Columbia while the NA1 clone has been shipped
with nursery plants from the West to the Southern and Southwestern US
[@goss2011phytophthora; @grunwald2012emergence; @goss2009population;
@ivors2006microsatellite; @prospero2009migration;
@mascheretti2008reconstruction]. The EU1 clonal lineage is the one first
discovered in Europe, but in 2007 the new EU2 lineage emerged in Northern
Ireland and since migrated to Western Scotland [@werres2001phytophthora;
@vanpoucke2012discovery]. EU1 was first introduced to Europe and eventually
migrated to the Pacific Northwest of North America [@goss2011phytophthora].

*P. ramorum* populations sampled in Oregon forests to date belong exclusively to
the NA1 clonal lineage [@hansen2008epidemiology; @prospero2007population]. Given
that NA2 and/or EU1 clones have been found in California, Oregon, Washington,
and/or British Columbia in association with nursery plant movements,
introduction of NA2 or EU1 from nursery environments to Curry County forests is
a plausible scenario [@goss2011phytophthora; @goss2009population;
@grunwald2012emergence; @prospero2009migration;
@prospero2007population]. Our present work thus monitors populations and
potential emergence of novel lineages in Oregon forests.

Our main objectives here are to describe the spatial and temporal pattern of the
populations and clonal dynamic of the SOD pathogen in Curry County in
southwestern Oregon from 2001 to the present. Specifically, we asked (1) if
novel lineages have been introduced into the forests in Curry County, (2) if
multiple introductions occurred, and (3) whether introduction might have come
from nursery populations. We sampled infected tanoaks between 2001-2014 and
characterized populations using microsatellite analysis.

## Materials and Methods

### Location

The SOD infested areas are located in the Siskiyou Mountains of Curry County in
south western Oregon near the town of Brookings (42.0575$^{\circ}$ N,
124.2864$^{\circ}$ W) on the coast (Figure \@ref(fig:ramorum1))
[@prospero2007population]. The Siskiyou mountains form part of the Klamath
Mountain range (Franklin and Dyrness 1988). The vegetation in SOD infested areas
is a mosaic of different vegetation types including mixed-evergreen, redwood
(*Sequoia sempervirens*) and Douglas-fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*) forests with
tanoak as the dominant SOD host.

```


### Sampling

Commencing in 2001, 2-4 aerial surveys per year were conducted over the tanoak
range by the Oregon Department of Forestry and the USDA Forest Service in Curry
County. The survey detects recently killed tanoaks based on the reddish-brown
color of foliage [@hansen2008epidemiology]. All trees identified by aerial
surveys were ground checked and geographically referenced using a hand-held GPS
instrument (Garmin GPS 12XL or 60CX, Garmin International, Olathe, KS). Bark or
foliage samples were collected for determination of *P. ramorum* presence by
culturing in the field and laboratory. Host plants within the area of the
delimitation survey, generally 300 feet, were also inspected and sampled if they
were symptomatic. Maps of distribution were prepared using ArcView GIS version
3.3 and ArcMap version 10.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands,
CA).

Isolations were made from symptomatic plant tissue onto selective CARP agar
(Difco corn meal agar, 10 ppm natamycin, 200pm NA-ampicillin, and 10 ppm
rifampicin) [@prospero2007population]. Candidate *Phytophthora* cultures were
transferred onto corn meal agar with 30 ppm $\beta$-sitosterol. *P. ramorum*
identification was confirmed by microscopic inspection for presence of
characteristic chlamydospores and deciduous sporangia [@werres2001phytophthora].
Genomic DNA was extracted using either the FastDNA SPIN kit (MP Biomedicals,
LLC; 116540600) [@goss2009population] or the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide
(CTAB )-chloroform-isopropanol method [@winton2001molecular]. Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum1) provides an overview of strains collected by year and region
following regions as shown in figure \@ref(fig:ramorum1).

### Genotyping, data validation, and harmonization

Five microsatellite loci were utilized in this analysis: PrMS6, Pr9C3, PrMS39,
PrMS45, and PrMS43 [@grunwald2009standardizing; @prospero2004isolation;
@prospero2007population; @grunwald2008susceptibility]. Genotyping (see specific
protocols in supplementary text) of *P. ramorum* strains collected 2001-2012
occurred over several years and in several laboratories, with different
protocols and sequencers. Consequently, a concerted effort was made to create a
comprehensive dataset with identical allele calls. To detect errors, allele
calls from all five genotyped loci were generated for a subsample of 40 isolates
representing the most common multilocus genotypes from the culture collection,
and then compared to data from participating laboratories. Three of the five
loci, PrMS6, Pr9C3, and PrMS39 had identical allele calls between laboratories
for the subsampled isolates. The remaining two loci, PrMS45 and PrMS43, had
allele calls that differed by a single bp between laboratories. Data from PrMS45
and PrMS43 were therefore corrected to allow consistent comparisons of allele
calls. Given the varied nature of the genotyping data described above genotyping
of *P. ramorum* strains consists of two datasets including either 5 loci
(2001-14) or a newly developed, multiplexed method including 14 loci (samples
2013-14) (Table \@ref(tab:ramorum2)). Details on both genotyping methods can be
found in the supplementary text \@ref(text:S1) and figure \@ref(fig:ramS1).

### Nursery populations

To determine if forest populations cluster with different nursery populations
from Oregon or California, we used previously published data from our work to
determine relationships among nursery and Curry County forest populations
[@goss2011phytophthora; @goss2009population; @grunwald2009standardizing;
@prospero2009migration; @prospero2007population].

### Data analysis

All individuals genotyped for this effort belonged to the NA1 clonal lineage
[@grunwald2009standardizing]. Thus, all analyses presented here focused on
describing the clonal dynamic using model-free approaches that avoid violation
of population genetic theory. Samples were grouped into different multilocus
genotypes (MLGs) defined by the unique combination of alleles across all
observed loci from the consensus five SSR loci genotyped across all years. For
identification purposes, unique MLGs were then assigned an arbitrary number from
1 to the total number of observed MLGs. Population genetic analysis was
conducted using the computer and statistical language R [@R2014] using various
packages as well as R functions written specifically for this project (see
github link below). Graphs and figures were created using the R packages
*ggplot2, ape, igraph, ggmap,* and *poppr* [@wickham2009ggplot2;
@csardi2006igraph; @paradis2004ape; @khale2013ggmap; @kamvar2014poppr]. 
Within-locus allelic diversity was analyzed across and within years and regions
using the function `locus_table()` from the R package *poppr* (Table S1)
[@kamvar2014poppr]. To address the temporal and spatial aspects of the data,
populations were analyzed both by year isolated and watershed region (Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum1); Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum1)). Watershed regions were drawn
with ArcMap version 10.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands,
CA). The regions represent drainages or portions of drainages in which infected
trees were discovered as the disease progressed over time. In most cases,
ridgelines dividing drainages formed the boundary of a region. These regions
were saved as shapefiles and imported into R with *rgdal* [@bivand2014rgdal].

Genotypic diversity was analyzed within and across years and populations, with
the Shannon-Wiener index (*H*) and the Stoddard and Taylor's index (*G*),
[@shannon2001mathematical; @stoddart1988genotypic]. Both *G* and *H* measure
genotypic diversity, combining richness and evenness. If all genotypes are
equally abundant, then the value of *G* will be the number of MLGs and the value
of *H* will be the natural log of the number of MLGs. Both *G* and *H* are used
as they weigh more or less abundant MLGs more heavily, respectively
[@grunwald2003analysis]. Evenness was calculated as *E~5~*, which is an
estimator of evenness that utilizes both *H* and *G* that gives a ratio of the
number of abundant genotypes to rare genotypes [@grunwald2003analysis;
@pielou1975ecological; @ludwig1988statistical]. These were calculated with the R
packages *poppr* and *vegan* [@oksanen2013vegan; @kamvar2014poppr]. Confidence
intervals were calculated using the R package *boot* with 9,999 bootstrap
resamplings [@canty2015boot]. Richness, or the expected number of MLGs (*eMLG*),
was calculated using rarefaction from the R packages *poppr* and *vegan*
[@hurlbert1971nonconcept; @heck1975explicit]. Some statistics (AMOVA, genotypic
diversity, index of association, allelic diversity, and Nei's distance) were
also performed on clone-censored data where each MLG was represented once per
population hierarchy.

Because the analysis of genotypic diversity, richness and evenness is agnostic
to specific alleles within MLGs, assessment of genetic relatedness between MLGs
was performed using the function `bruvo.dist()` using *poppr*, which calculates
Bruvo's genetic distance, utilizing a stepwise mutation model for microsatellite
loci [@bruvo2004simple; @kamvar2014poppr]. This distance thus gives a more 
fine-scale picture of relationships between individuals than band-sharing
models. These relationships were visualized with minimum spanning networks
generated using the R packages *igraph* and *poppr* [@csardi2006igraph;
@kamvar2014poppr].

If the epidemic had a single origin, a correlation between genetic and
geographic distance would be expected as populations acquire mutations over time
and clonally diverge regardless of rates of spread. Divergence is affected by
rates and distance of spread where long-distance dispersal or low rates of
mutation would lead to less divergence and thus lower correlations between
genetic and geographic distances. This was tested by performing Mantel tests
across all hierarchical levels in the data set utilizing the function
`mantel.randtest()` in the R package *ade4* between Bruvo's distance as
described above and Euclidean distances between geographic coordinates
[@mantel1967detection; @dray2007ade4]. *P*-values were calculated using 99,999
bootstrap replicates.

As the eradication efforts destroy the immediate habitat in an infected area,
one question that we wanted to address was whether or not genotypes were
clustering to specific regions or if they were evenly spread throughout Curry
County [@prospero2007population]. This was tested using three methods: bootstrap
analysis of Nei's genetic distance, Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA), and
Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) in the R packages *poppr*,
*ade4*, and *adegenet* [@jombart2010discriminant; @excoffier1992analysis;
@kamvar2014poppr]. The bootstrap analysis utilized 10,000 bootstrap replicates
treating loci as independent units with the function `aboot()` in *poppr* and
was visualized as an unrooted neighbor-joining tree in figtree v. 1.4.2 (Figure
\@ref(fig:ramorum5)). AMOVA utilizes a distance matrix between genotypes for
which hierarchical partitions are defined and attempts to analyze the variation
within samples, between samples, between subpopulations within populations and
finally between populations. In this case, we used both the hierarchies of
samples within years within regions and samples within regions within years.
DAPC is a multivariate, model-free approach to clustering based on prior
population information [@jombart2010discriminant]. This allows us to analyze the
population structure by assessing how well samples can be reassigned into
previously defined populations. Both DAPC and AMOVA were run with and without
Hunter Creek and Pistol River South Fork due to isolated genotypes and small
sample size, respectively. For the DAPC analysis, these removed populations had
their origins predicted from the DAPC object using the function predict.dapc in
the R package *adegenet* [@jombart2010discriminant].

Since DAPC is sensitive to the number of principal components used in analysis,
the function `xvalDapc()` from the R package *adegenet* was used to select the
correct number of principal components with 1,000 replicates using a training
set of 90% of the data. The number of principal components was chosen based on
the criteria that it had to produce the highest average percent of successful
reassignment and lowest root mean squared error [@jombart2010discriminant].
Significant deviations from random population structure was tested in AMOVA
utilizing the function `randtest()` from the R package *ade4* with 9,999
bootstrap replicates [@dray2007ade4].

All data and R scripts to reproduce the analyses shown here are deposited
publicly on github
(<https://github.com/grunwaldlab/Sudden_Oak_Death_in_Oregon_Forests>) and
citable (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13007).

## Results

### Demographic pattern and genetic diversity

The epidemic has expanded over time from the initial focus in Joe Hall Creek NE
of Brookings, Oregon mostly north (first to N Fork Chetco High) and northwest
(Coast, Pistol River South Fork), but also east (Chetco Main and Winchuck) (Fig.
\@ref(fig:ramorum1); Table \@ref(tab:ramorum1)). To date a total of 70 
multilocus genotypes have been found in forest populations (Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum1)). MLG 22 is most abundant and the only MLG detected across
the whole period (although it was not sampled in every year) (Fig.
\@ref(fig:ramorum2)). MLG 59, the second most abundant MLG, was only detected in
2011 and has a high frequency due to the sampling design applied: all 2011
strains were sampled in one concentrated area in the northwestern sampling range
geographically distant from any other location (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum2)). Given
that sampling strategies for some years were not comprehensive, samples from
some years have to be interpreted with caution (e.g., 2005-6, 2010-11). Samples
from 2013 and 2014 are sampled from all regions and can be considered more
representative.

cap <- "Rank distribution of multilocus genotypes (MLGs) of *P.
ramorum* and recovery per year. The vertical axis denotes unique MLGs
detected in the whole data set with decreasing abundance as indicated by
the barplot on the right side. The horizontal axis indicates year of
sampling. Each numbered circle represents the number of observations of
each MLG with lines connecting genotypes found in multiple years."

```

Allelic and genotype diversity within loci revealed that PrMS43 had, on average,
the highest number of alleles (n = 18). All other loci had 5 or fewer alleles
with a moderate to high amount of diversity (Table S2). Nevertheless, the
genotype accumulation curve showed a slight plateau, indicating that we have
enough power in our data to describe a significant number of MLGs (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS2)).
Genotypic diversity (*H* = 2.98, *G* = 8.64), evenness (*E~5~* = 0.41), and
richness (*eMLG* = 7) were low as expected for a clonal population slowly
accumulating mutations over space and time (Table S3). A pattern of increasing
diversity across years (with number of MLGs not fewer than 10) was also observed
(Table S3). The minimum spanning network showed that MLGs 17, 22, and 28
clustered in the center of the network and had the highest number of connections
to other genotypes in the forest populations (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum3)). Most
genotypes were connected to their immediate neighbors by a genetic distance of
0.05 or the equivalent of one mutational step across 5 diploid loci.


```{r, ramorum3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = figcap3, fig.scap = figscap3}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/phytopathology/figure_3.png")
cap <- "Minimum spanning network based on Bruvo's genetic distance
for microsatellite markers for *P. ramorum* populations. Nodes (circles)
represent individual multilocus genotypes. The 10 most abundant forest
genotypes are labeled with their MLG designation. Node colors represent
population membership proportional to the pie size. Node sizes are
relatively scaled to *log~1.75~n,* where *n* is the number of samples in
the nodes to avoid node overlap. Edges (lines) represent minimum genetic
distance between individuals determined by Prim's algorithm. Nodes that
are more closely related will have darker and thicker edges whereas
nodes more distantly related will have lighter and thinner edges or no
edge at all. Reticulation was introduced by finding exact ties in
genetic distance after Prim's algorithm was run. Subgroups of >3 MLGs
where all nodes are no more than one mutational step (d = 0.05) away
from its neighbors, are highlighted in arbitrary colors."

scap <- "Minimum spanning network based on Bruvo's genetic distance
for microsatellite markers for *P. ramorum* populations."

cat(beaverdown::iflatex("\\newpage"))
```


### Spatial Correlation

A Mantel test revealed significant correlations of genetic distance and
geographic distance for most samples collected after 2003 (Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum3)). When partitioned by year, this correlation appears to
increase and become more pronounced with the progression of the epidemic. When
partitioned by region, those that are closer to the origin of the epidemic (Joe
Hall Creek and N Fork Chetco River) show significant correlation. When the
overall mantel test was run without Hunter Creek, the correlation coefficient
was reduced (0.175), but was still significant (*p* = 0.0001).

### Population differentiation

Cluster analysis of populations with respect to year using Nei's genetic
distance showed no significant (&gt;70%) bootstrap support for any clades, but
does show that these tend to cluster by region as opposed to year (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS3)).
AMOVA analysis revealed significant population structure between regions on both
clone-corrected (with respect to hierarchy) and uncorrected data sets (Table
\@ref(tab:ramtab4)). Significant structure was only found between years within
regions on the uncorrected data set. Both patterns were observed without Hunter
Creek and Pistol River South Fork isolates. DAPC clustering showed that the
first discriminant component separated Hunter Creek from all other regions and
the second discriminant component shows a gradient from Joe Hall Creek to the
coast (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramfig4)). This distinction was reflected in the percent
of correct posterior assignment of isolates to their original populations. Over
the whole data set there was an 81.5% assignment-success rate. Hunter Creek
received 100% successful reassignment. Joe Hall Creek, Winchuck, and Coast all
had &gt;85% successful reassignment whereas Chetco Main, North Fork of the
Chetco, and Pistol River South Fork all had &lt;69% successful reassignment
(Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS4)). The isolation of the Hunter Creek isolates in the DAPC analysis was
found to be mainly driven by allele 493 at locus PrMS43 (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS5)). The only
other population to share this allele was Joe Hall Creek where it was present in
a total of 4 isolates, and only isolates found in the coastal region or North
Fork Chetco contained the allele 489, which is one mutational step away in a
stepwise mutation model of a tetranucleotide repeat locus. When DAPC was run
without Hunter Creek and Pistol River South Fork data, percent successful
reassignment for all regions did not change significantly. Prediction of sources
for the Hunter Creek data revealed that over 98% of the genotypes were assigned
to the Coast with a 99% probability.

### Clustering of forest with nursery populations

We used previously published data to determine if nursery populations in
California or Oregon could have been source populations for the Oregon forest
epidemic [@goss2011phytophthora; @goss2009population;
@grunwald2009standardizing; @prospero2009migration;
@prospero2007population]. Nursery data included 40 MLGs across 216 samples of
NA1 clones. Of these 40, 12 MLGs matched the forest sample and 28 MLGs were
unique to the nurseries. The only region that did not contain genotypes that
matched those found in nurseries was Pistol River South Fork. When considering
those 12 genotypes that were present in both data sets, with the exception of
Joe Hall Creek, all genotypes were first isolated from nurseries before
discovery in the forest. At the most variable locus, PrMS43, both nursery
populations had the allele 281 at frequencies of 4.5% and 4.9% for CA and OR,
respectively. This allele was not observed in the forest population. Both
populations contained allele 489 at &gt;10% frequency and the CA nursery
population contained allele 493 at a frequency of 1.4%.

When nursery genotypes were added to the minimum spanning network, MLGs found at
Hunter Creek, previously isolated in the network, connected by only a single MLG
from the coast, gained more connections to nursery MLGs. Clustering with Nei's
distance revealed the Nursery isolates from CA consistently clustering closest
with Hunter Creek isolates in both clone-corrected and uncorrected data sets
(Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum5)). DAPC clustering revealed a decrease in overall
assignment-success rate at 78%. The nursery isolates received 74% and 83%
assignment success for CA and OR nurseries, respectively.

```{r, ramorum5, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = figcap5, fig.scap = figscap5}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/phytopathology/figure_5.png")
cap <- "Unrooted, neighbor-joining tree with 10,000 bootstrap
replicates of Nei's genetic distance for *P. ramorum* populations
defined by region. Tip labels are colored by region. Branches with
bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown in blue. Nursery populations
are shown as originating from California (CA) or Oregon (OR)."

scap <- "Unrooted, neighbor-joining tree with 10,000 bootstrap
replicates of Nei's genetic distance for *P. ramorum* populations
defined by region."

figcap5  <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = cap, figname = "fig5", to = TO)
figscap5 <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = scap, figname = "fig5s", to = TO)
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(beaverdown::iflatex("\\newpage"))
```


The assignment successes for the regions before or after inclusion of nursery
data changed less than 5% for all regions except for the coast, which saw a
decrease of 17.6% when nursery populations were included (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS4)). Prediction
of sources for nursery genotypes against the forest data revealed that 48% of
these nursery isolates were predicted to share membership with the coast at
$\geq$ 95% probability (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS6), \@ref(fig:ramS7)). A total of 3.2% of the isolates were
predicted to share membership with Hunter Creek at $\geq$ 99.9% membership
probability. Furthermore, 21.75% of the nursery data could not be assigned to
any of the forest populations at &gt;60% probability.

Since 3.2% of the nursery isolates had a very strong signal for Hunter Creek, we
predicted sources for Hunter Creek isolates when considering nursery isolates.
This approach determines if Hunter Creek isolates cluster more readily with
nursery or coast populations. Indeed, 92% of the Hunter Creek isolates were
predicted to share membership with California nurseries at $\geq$ 99% membership
probability (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS8)). No Hunter Creek isolate was predicted to share membership
with a forest population at &gt;0.45% membership probability.

## Discussion

To date populations monitored from 2001-14 show presence of only the NA1 clonal
lineage observed previously [@prospero2007population; @prospero2009migration].
The fact that individuals belonging to the EU1 and NA2 clonal lineages have not
been found in Oregon forests, despite their presence on the west coast from
British Columbia to California is welcome news [@goss2009population;
@goss2011phytophthora; @grunwald2012emergence]. The lack of EU1 or NA2 isolates
provides evidence that monitoring for *P. ramorum* in nurseries by federal and
state agencies is helping avoid emergence of new clones in Oregon's Forests.

Our analysis provides support for a most parsimonious scenario of two
introductions into Curry county from nurseries: one initial introduction into
Curry County sometime before detection of the first infected tanoaks in 2001
from California (or less likely Oregon) nurseries followed by a second
introduction into the Hunter Creek area again from nurseries. The relative
position of the nursery populations in the minimum spanning network and DAPC
scatter plot (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum3), \@ref(fig:ramfig4)) suggest that the
introductions from nurseries were rare, though more even sampling and migration
models could disprove this hypothesis. Since 2001, the epidemic has spread
clonally throughout Southwestern Curry County mostly north, but also west,
towards the coast, and southeast. This clonal spread of the pathogen from the
Joe Hall area is supported partially by Mantel tests showing significant levels
of isolation by distance in years following 2002 (Table \@ref(tab:ramorum3))
along with significant AMOVA results across regions (Table \@ref(tab:ramtab4)).
The populations sampled in 2011 in Hunter Creek (Cape Sebastian) appear to have
originated from a new source and cluster into a distinct group based on DAPC
(Fig. \@ref(fig:ramfig4)). Based on the minimum spanning network, this
population would appear isolated in the epidemic if it were not for MLG 32,
which is connected with MLG 33 (found on the coast in 2010) by one mutational
step at locus PrMS43. This, in turn, is connected with the other MLGs from
Hunter Creek by one mutational step at locus PrMS39. When considering clustering
via Bruvo's distance in combination with data from nursery populations, however,
these genotypes from Hunter Creek appear to be more similar to California
nursery populations (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramorum3)) than Oregon forest populations.
Predictions based on DAPC place samples from Hunter Creek as coming from
California nurseries (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS8)). This, in combination with the observation that
purely forest genotypes (i.e. those only found in the forest) are connected to
Hunter Creek genotypes through nursery genotypes, indicates a possible
contribution from nursery populations to the epidemic. This is supported by the
observation that all population level clustering, with and without clone
correction, places the Hunter Creek isolates adjacent to the nursery isolates
from CA (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramfig4), \@ref(fig:ramorum5)). This appears to be
driven by the high frequency of allele 246 at locus PrMS39, which interestingly
appears to segregate in an east to west fashion and is increasing in frequency
over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS9), \@ref(fig:ramS10)). This, along with the results from the DAPC clustering
and subsequent prediction (Fig. \@ref(fig:ramS6), \@ref(fig:ramS7)) provide weak support for a potential
third introduction into the coastal region from nurseries sometime after the
Hunter Creek introduction event.

An interesting aspect is the observation that there appeared to be more than one
cluster of genotypes introduced into the Joe Hall area during the early stages
of the epidemic. The two dominant clusters that appeared were the ones that
contained MLG 22 and MLG 68. The former has been found in the most recent
sampling year, whereas the latter has not been observed since 2005 or beyond the
Joe Hall area. This latter group was also the most distantly related group
overall, more distant than some nursery genotypes. While it is clear that the
eradication effort has not been entirely successful, there is some evidence that
it is having an effect as a major genotype cluster has effectively been
eradicated, although disappearance of MLGs could also be explained by being less
fit than lineages dominating now.

The Curry County epidemic is in many ways different from the epidemic in
California. When introduced into California in the mid 1990's, the causal agent
of sudden oak death was unknown and thus gave it time to clonally expand and
diversify as management strategies in natural forest systems were limited
[@rizzo2002phytophthora]. With the foresight of the epidemic in central
California, the ODF was able to implement a quarantine effort against the import
of hosts as soon as the causal agent was known (A Kanaskie, pers. comm.). This
quarantine along with aggressive eradication efforts have affected the spread of
*P. ramorum* [@mascheretti2008reconstruction]. Drawing conclusions from previous
population studies in California and applying them to the Oregon epidemic should
be undertaken with great care given the drastically differing management
scenarios [@mascheretti2008reconstruction; @mascheretti2009genetic].

Our work has some inherent drawbacks. Given the cost of aerial surveys and
subsequent ground crew work, and the fact that trees are eradicated once found,
populations are not hierarchically sampled across all years. The destructive
nature of the management approach means that it was not possible to conduct
controlled ecological experiments focusing on effects of climate and rainfall on
the spread of disease as was possible in California trials [@eyre2013poulation].
In addition, most of our work only used 5 microsatellite loci for genotyping.
Ideally, more loci should have been used as was done in other studies
[@croucher2013combining]. Although only 5 loci were used, clear patterns of
population dynamics in space and time emerged and the MLG accumulation curve
supported the fact that loci are informative. Finally, the populations genotyped
here are clonal and belong to the NA1 clonal lineage. Thus, much of the
analytical power provided by population genetic theory does not apply given that
basic assumptions would be violated [@grunwald2011evolution]. Our work uses
appropriate methods to infer patterns that are model free, yet informative such
as spatial clustering. Thus, we believe that this work provides novel and
important insights into the *P. ramorum* population biology in the Siskiyou
forest. Our data indicates that there might have been at least two introductions
into Oregon forests from nurseries. The nature of the data does not allow
inference of directional migrations given the uneven sampling strategy and
moderate number of loci used across all years. We are currently exploring
genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) as a method that could provide further detail on
how these populations evolved over space and time [@elshire2011robust]. GBS can
provide richer detail by providing codominant SNP data across several thousand
loci sampling the whole genome.

### Supplementary Text {#text:S1}

For the years up to and including 2012, the multilocus genotype (MLG) of each
*P. ramorum* strain was determined based on microsatellite analysis of five
loci, PrMS6, Pr9C3, PrMS39, PrMS45 and PrMS43, using previously published
protocols [@grunwald2009standardizing; @prospero2004isolation;
@prospero2007population; @grunwald2008susceptibility]. Multilocus genotyping of 
*P. ramorum* strains collected in 2013 and 2014 included an extra nine loci,
KI18, KI64, KI82a, KI82b, ILVOPrMS79, ILVOPrMS131, ILVOPrMS145a, ILVOPrMS145b,
ILVOPrMS145c which are amplified by an additional six primer pairs
[@ivors2006microsatellite; @vercauteren2011identification; 
@vercauteren2010clonal]. The locus ILVOPrMS79, amplifies up to three alleles,
however two separate loci have yet to be described
[@vercauteren2011identification]. The addition of nine loci to the genotyping
assay coincided with the discovery by the Oregon Department of Agriculture of an
EU1 *P. ramorum* isolate in a Curry County nursery in 2012. Preceding 2012, only
NA1 isolates had been found in Curry County. Because different loci are
polymorphic for different clonal lineages, the entire panel of 14 loci was
necessary to adequately describe the *P. ramorum* population in the event that
multiple lineages were discovered in the forest.

Methods for genotyping the 2013 and 2014 *P. ramorum* strains with all 14 loci
use new multiplex protocol. Previously published primers were modified by the
addition of a 5' PIG tail "GTTT" to reverse primers in an effort to reduced
stutter peaks and hence to better facilitate allele scoring (Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum2)) [@brownstein1996modulation]. In two cases (PrMS45, PrMS6),
a PIG tail was not added to reverse primers to simplify scoring of overlapping
alleles. Also, where a T residue was already present at the 5' end of a reverse
primer, as in the case of KI18, a "GTT" was added instead of "GTTT". Forward
primers were assigned fluorescent labels, 6-FAM, NED, VIC, or PET, to facilitate
separation of overlapping markers (Table \@ref(tab:ramorum2)). Primer
concentrations were determined by visual inspection of electropherograms (Table
\@ref(tab:ramorum2)).

Amplification of all 14 loci was separated into three reactions (8-plex, 2-plex
and simplex). The simplex reaction amplified the PrMS43 locus using methods
described earlier [@prospero2007population; @grunwald2009standardizing]. The
8-plex and 2-plex amplified the remaining loci and were performed under
identical conditions with the exception of primers and primer concentrations
(Table \@ref(tab:ramorum2)). For the multiplex reactions, the QIAGEN Type-it
Mutation Detect PCR Kit (QIAGEN, 206343, Valencia, CA) was used. Multiplex PCR
reactions were performed in 5$\mu$l volumes with 10ng template DNA and1X final
buffer concentration. Amplifications were run on a Veriti thermal cycler (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with an initial denaturation at 95 $^{\circ}$C
for 5 min, followed by 33 cycles of 95 $^{\circ}$C for 30 s, 60 $^{\circ}$C for
90 s, and 72 $^{\circ}$C for 20 s, and a final extension at 60 $^{\circ}$C for
30 min. Genotyping prior to 2012 included three reference DNA lineages (EU1,
NA1, and NA2). After 2012, a fourth lineage (EU2) was added as a reference
[@vanpoucke2012discovery].

Electrophoresis and visualization of all microsatellites were performed on
ABI3100, ABI3100 Avant, or ABI3130 genetic analyzers (Applied Biosystems). For
evaluation of the loci, genotyped prior to 2013, the PCR products were diluted
10 times in ultrapure H~2~0 and 1.5 $\mu$l of diluted product was added to both
8.5 $\mu$l of Hi-Di\textsuperscript{TM} Formamide (Applied Biosystems, 4311320)
and 0.25 $\mu$l of GeneScan\textsuperscript{TM} 500 LIZ\textsuperscript{TM} size
standard (Applied Biosystems, 4322682). The simplex reaction (PrMS43) was also
diluted 10 times while the 8-plex and 2-plex products were diluted 75 times.
After dilution, 2.5 $\mu$l of the 8-plex, 2-plex and simplex products were added
to 7.5 $\mu$l of Hi-Di\textsuperscript{TM} Formamide containing
GeneScan\textsuperscript{TM} 500 LIZ\textsuperscript{TM} size standard at a
ratio of 6 $\mu$l size standard to 1 ml Hi-Di\textsuperscript{TM} Formamide.
Allele sizing was determined using GeneMapper\textregistered{} v3.7 and v5.0
software (Applied Biosystems).

## Abstract

To gain a detailed understanding of how plant microbes evolve and adapt to
hosts, pesticides, and other factors, knowledge of the population dynamics and
evolutionary history of populations is crucial. Plant pathogen populations are
often clonal or partially clonal which requires different analytical tools. With
the advent of high throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining genome-wide
population genetic data has become easier than ever before. We previously
contributed the R package *poppr* specifically addressing issues with analysis
of clonal populations. In this paper we provide several significant extensions
to *poppr* with a focus on large, genome-wide SNP data. Specifically, we provide
several new functionalities including the new function `mlg.filter` to define
clone boundaries allowing for inspection and definition of what is a clonal
lineage, minimum spanning networks with reticulation, a sliding-window analysis
of the index of association, modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance, and
analyses across any level of hierarchies.

## Introduction

To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in the field of plant-microbe interactions
makes sense except in the light of population genetics [@dobzhansky2013nothing].
Genetic forces such as selection and drift act on alleles in a population. Thus,
a true understanding of how plant pathogens emerge, evolve and adapt to crops,
fungicides, or other factors, can only be elucidated in the context of
population level phenomena given the demographic history of populations
[@Mcdonald2002;
@grunwald2011evolution; @milgroom1989population]. The field of population
genetics, in the era of whole genome resequencing, provides unprecedented power
to describe the evolutionary history and population processes that drive
coevolution between pathogens and hosts. This powerful field thus critically
enables effective deployment of R genes, design of pathogen informed plant
resistance breeding programs, and implementation of fungicide rotations that
minimize emergence of resistance.

Most computational tools for population genetics are based on concepts developed
for sexual model organisms. Populations that reproduce clonally or are polyploid
are thus difficult to characterize using classical population genetic tools
because theoretical assumptions underlying the theory are violated. Yet, many
plant pathogen populations are at least partially clonal if not completely
clonal [@milgroom1996recombination; @anderson1995clonality]. Thus, development
of tools for analysis of clonal or polyploid populations is needed.

Genotyping by sequencing and whole genome resequencing provide the unprecedented
ability to identify thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
populations [@elshire2011robust; @luikart2003power; @davey2011genome]. With
traditional marker data (e.g., SSR, AFLP) a clone was typically defined as a
unique multilocus genotype (MLG) [@grunwald2006hierarchical; @Falush01082003;
@goss2009population; @cooke2012genome; @taylor2003fungal]. Availability of large
SNP data sets provides new challenges for data analysis. These data are based on
reduced representation libraries and high throughput sequencing with moderate
sequencing depth which invariably results in substantial missing data, error in
SNP calling due to sequencing error, lack of read depth or other sources of
spurious allele calls [@mastretta2015restriction]. It is thus not clear what a
clone is in large SNP data sets and novel tools are required for definition of
clone boundaries.

The research community using the R statistical and computing language [@R] has
developed a plethora of new resources for population genetic analysis. R is
particularly appealing because all code is open source and functions can be
evaluated and modified by any user. Recently, we introduced the R package
*poppr* specifically developed for analysis of clonal populations
[@kamvar2014poppr]. *Poppr* previously introduced several novel features
including the ability to conduct a hierarchical analysis across unlimited
hierarchies, test for linkage association, graph minimum spanning networks or
provide bootstrap support for Bruvo's distance in resulting trees. *Poppr* has
been rapidly adopted and applied to a range of studies including for example
horizontal transmission in leukemia of clams [@metzger2015horizontal], study of
the vector-mediated parent-to-offspring transmission in an avian malaria-like
parasite [@chakarov2015apparent], and characterization of the emergence of the
invasive forest pathogen *Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus* [@gross2014population].
It has also been used to implement real-time, online R based tools for
visualizing relationships among unknown MLGs in reference databases  
(http://phytophthora-id.org/) [@grunwald2011phytophthora].

Here, we introduce *poppr* 2.0, which provides a major update to *poppr*
[@kamvar2014poppr] including novel tools for analysis of clonal populations
specifically addressing large SNP data. Significant novel tools include
functions for calculating clone boundaries and collapsing individuals into
clonal groups based on a user-specified genetic distance threshold, sliding
window analyses, genotype accumulation curves, reticulations in minimum spanning
networks, and bootstrapping for any genetic distance.

## Implementations and Examples

### Clonal identification

As highlighted in previous work, clone correction is an important component of
population genetic analysis of organisms that are known to reproduce asexually
[@kamvar2014poppr; @milgroom1996recombination; @grunwald2003analysis]. This
method is a partial correction for bias that affects metrics that rely on allele
frequencies assuming panmixia and was initially designed for data with only a
handful of markers. With the advent of large-scale sequencing and reduced-
representation libraries, it has become easier to sequence tens of thousands of
markers from hundreds of individuals [@elshire2011robust; @davey2011genome;
@davey2010rad]. With this larger number of markers, the genetic resolution is
much greater, but the chance of genotyping error is also greatly increased and
missing data is frequent [@mastretta2015restriction]. Taking this fact and
occasional somatic mutations into account, it would be impossible to separate
true clones from independent individuals by just comparing what MLGs are
different. We introduce a new method for collapsing unique multilocus genotypes
determined by naive string comparison into multilocus lineages utilizing any
genetic distance given three different clustering algorithms: farthest neighbor,
nearest neighbor, and UPGMA (average neighbor) [@sokal1958statistical].

These clustering algorithms act on a distance matrix that is either provided by
the user or generated via a function that will calculate a distance from genetic
data such as `bruvo.dist`, which in particular applies to any level of ploidy
[@bruvo2004simple]. All algorithms have been implemented in C and utilize the
OpenMP framework for optional parallel processing [@dagum1998openmp]. Default is
the conservative farthest neighbor algorithm (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)A), which
will only cluster samples together if all samples in the cluster are at a
distance less than the given threshold. By contrast, the nearest neighbor
algorithm will have a chaining effect that will cluster samples akin to adding
links on a chain where a sample can be included in a cluster if all of the
samples have at least one connection below a given threshold (Fig.
\@ref(fig:Figure1)C). The UPGMA, or average neighbor clustering algorithm is the
one most familiar to biologists as it is often used to generate ultra-metric
trees based on genetic distance (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure1)B). This algorithm will
cluster by creating a representative sample per cluster and joining clusters if
these representative samples are closer than the given threshold.

next to the lines. All outer angles are 90 degrees, so the un-labeled edge
weights can be obtained with simply geometry. Colored circles represent clusters
of genotypes. (**A**) Farthest neighbor clustering does not cluster nodes B and
C because nodes A and C are more than a distance of 0.451 apart. (**B**) UPGMA
(average neighbor) clustering clusters nodes A, B, and C together because the
average distance between them and  C is < 0.451. (**C**) Nearest neighbor
clustering clusters all nodes together because the minimum distance between them
is always < 0.451."

figcap1  <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = cap, figname = "fig1")
figscap1 <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = scap, figname = "fig1s")
```

We utilize data from the microbe *Phytophthora infestans* to show how the
`mlg.filter` function collapses multilocus genotypes with Bruvo's distance
assuming a genome addition model [@bruvo2004simple]. *P. infestans* is the
causal agent of potato late blight originating from Mexico that spread to Europe
in the mid 19th century [@goss2014irish; @yoshida2013rise]. *P. infestans*
reproduces both clonally and sexually. The clonal lineages of *P. infestans*
have been formally defined into 18 separate clonal lineages using a combination
of various molecular methods including AFLP and microsatellite markers
[@lees2006novel; @li2013efficient]. For these data, we used `mlg.filter` to
detect all of the distance thresholds at which 18 multilocus lineages would be
resolved. We used these thresholds to define multilocus lineages and create
contingency tables and dendrograms to determine how well the multilocus lineages
were detected.

For the *P. infestans* population, the three algorithms were able to detect 18
multilocus lineages at different distance thresholds (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure-2)).
Contingency tables between the described multilocus genotypes and the genotypes
defined by distance show that most of the 18 lineages were resolved, except for
US-8, which is polytomic (Table \@ref(pinftable)).

We utilized simulated data to evaluate the effect of sequencing error and
missing data on MLG calling. We constructed the data using the `glSim` function
in *adegenet* [@jombart2011adegenet] to obtain a SNP data set for demonstration.
Two diploid data sets were created, each with 10k SNPs (25% structured into two
groups) and 200 samples with 10 ancestral populations of even sizes. Clones were
created in one data set by marking each sample with a unique identifier and then
randomly sampling with replacement. It is well documented that reduced-
representation sequencing can introduce several erroneous calls and missing data
[@mastretta2015restriction]. To reflect this, we mutated SNPs at a rate of 10%
and inserted an average of 10% missing data for each sample after clones were
created, ensuring that no two sequences were alike. The number of mutations and
missing data per sample were determined by sampling from a Poisson distribution
with $\lambda = 1000$. After pooling, 20% of the data set was randomly sampled
for analysis. Genetic distance was obtained with the function `bitwise.dist`,
which calculates the fraction of different sites between samples equivalent to
Provesti's distance, counting missing data as equivalent in comparison
[@prevosti1975distances].

All three filtering algorithms were run with a threshold of 1, returning a
numeric vector of length $n - 1$ where each element represented a threshold at
which two samples/clusters would join. Since each data set would have varying
distances between samples, the clonal boundary threshold was defined as the
midpoint of the largest gap between two thresholds that collapsed less than 50%
of the data.

Out of the 100 simulations run, we found that across all methods, detection of
duplicated samples had $\sim$ 98% true positive fraction and $\sim$ 0.8% false
positive fraction indicating that this method is robust to simulated
populations (supplementary materials[^1]).

### Minimum Spanning Networks with Reticulation

In its original iteration, *poppr* introduced minimum spanning networks that
were based on the *igraph* function `minimum.spanning.tree` [@csardi2006igraph].
This algorithm produces a minimum spanning tree with no reticulations where
nodes represent individual MLGs. In other minimum spanning network programs,
reticulation is obtained by calculating the minimum spanning tree several times
and returning the set of all edges included in the trees. Due to the way
*igraph* has implemented Prim's algorithm, it is not possible to utilize this
strategy, thus we implemented an internal C function to walk the space of
minimum spanning trees based on genetic distance to connect groups of nodes with
edges of equal weight.

To demonstrate the utility of minimum spanning networks with reticulation, we
used two clonal data sets: the H3N2 flu virus data from the *adegenet* package
using years of each epidemic as the population factor, and *Phytophthora
ramorum* data from Nurseries and Oregon forests [@jombart2010discriminant;
@kamvar2014sudden]. Minimum spanning networks were created with and without
reticulation using the *poppr* functions `diss.dist` and `bruvo.msn` for the
H3N2 and *P. ramorum* data, respectively [@kamvar2014poppr; @bruvo2004simple].
To detect mlg clusters, the infoMAP community detection algorithm was applied
with 10,000 trials as implemented in the R package *igraph* version 0.7.1
utilizing genetic distance as edge weights and number of samples in each MLG as
vertex weights [@csardi2006igraph; @rosvall2008maps].

To evaluate the results, we compared the number, size, and entropy ($H$) of the
resulting communities as we expect a highly clonal organism with low genetic
diversity to result in a few, large communities. We also created contingency
tables of the community assignments with the defined populations and used those
to calculate entropy using Shannon's index with the function `diversity` from
the R package *vegan* version 2.2-1 [@oksanen2015vegan;
@shannon2001mathematical]. A low entropy indicates presence of a few large
communities whereas high entropy indicates presence of many small communities.

The infoMAP algorithm revealed 63 communities with a maximum community size of
77 and $H = 3.56$ for the reticulate network of the H3N2 data and 117
communities with a maximum community size of 26 and $H = 4.65$ for the minimum
spanning tree. The entropy across years was greatly decreased for all
populations with the reticulate network compared to the minimum spanning tree
(Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure-3)). Note that the reticulated network (Fig.
\@ref(fig:Figure-3)B) showed patterns corresponding with those resulting from a
discriminant analysis of principal components (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure-3)D)
[@jombart2010discriminant].

[@Jombart_2008; @jombart2010discriminant]. Each node represents a unique

figcap3  <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = cap, figname = "fig3")
```

Graph walking of the reticulated minimum spanning network of *P. ramorum* by the
infoMAP algorithm revealed 16 communities with a maximum community size of 13
and $H = 2.60$. The un-reticulated minimum spanning tree revealed 20 communities
with a maximum community size of 7 and $H = 2.96$. In the ability to predict
Hunter Creek as belonging to a single community, the reticulated network was
successful whereas the minimum spanning tree separated one genotype from that
community. The entropy for the reticulated network was lower for all populations
except for the coast population (supplementary materials[^1]).

### Bootstrapping

Assessing population differentiation through methods such as $G_{st}$, AMOVA,
and Mantel tests relies on comparing samples within and across populations
[@nei1973analysis; @excoffier1992analysis; @mantel1967detection]. Confidence in
distance metrics is related to the confidence in the markers to accurately
represent the diversity of the data. Especially true with microsatellite
markers, a single hyper-diverse locus can make a population appear to have more
diversity based on genetic distance. Using a bootstrapping procedure of randomly
sampling loci with replacement when calculating a distance matrix provides
support for clades in hierarchical clustering.

Data in genind and genpop objects are represented as matrices with individuals
in rows and alleles in columns [@Jombart_2008]. This gives the advantage of
being able to use R's matrix algebra capabilities to efficiently calculate
genetic distance. Unfortunately, this also means that bootstrapping is a non-
trivial task as all alleles at a single locus need to be sampled together. To
remedy this, we have created an internal S4 class called "bootgen", which
extends the internal "gen" class from *adegenet*. This class can be created from
any genind, genclone, or genpop object, and allows loci to be sampled with
replacement. To further facilitate bootstrapping, a function called `aboot`,
which stands for "any boot", is introduced that will bootstrap any genclone,
genind, or genpop object with any genetic distance that can be calculated from
it.

To demonstrate calculating a dendrogram with bootstrap support, we used the
*poppr* function `aboot` on population allelic frequencies derived from the data
set `microbov` in the *adegenet* package with 1000 bootstrap replicates
[@Jombart_2008; @laloe2007consensus]. The resulting dendrogram shows bootstrap
support values $>50\%$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:microboot)) and used the following code:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cap <- "UPGMA dendrogram generated from Nei's genetic distance on 15 breeds
of *Bos taurus* (BT) or *Bos indicus* (BI) from Africa (AF) or France (FR).
These data are from @laloe2007consensus. Node labels represent bootstrap support
$>50\\%$ out of 1,000 bootstrap replicates."

figscap4 <- "UPGMA dendrogram generated from Nei's genetic distance"
figcap4  <- beaverdown::render_caption(caption = cap, figname = "fig4")
```

```{r, microboot, results = "hide", fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = paste(figcap4), fig.scap = paste(figscap4)}
library("poppr");
data("microbov", package = "adegenet");
strata(microbov) <- data.frame(other(microbov));
setPop(microbov) <- ~coun/spe/breed;
bov_pop <- genind2genpop(microbov);

set.seed(20150428);
pop_tree <- aboot(bov_pop, sample = 1000, cutoff = 50);
```

### Genotype Accumulation Curve

Analysis of population genetics of clonal organisms often borrows from
ecological methods such as analysis of diversity within populations
[@milgroom1996recombination; @arnaud2007standardizing; @grunwald2003analysis].
When choosing markers for analysis, it is important to make sure that the
observed diversity in your sample will not appreciably increase if an additional
marker is added [@arnaud2007standardizing]. This concept is analogous to a
species accumulation curve, obtained by rarefaction. The genotype accumulation
curve in *poppr* is implemented in the function `genotype_curve`. The curve is
constructed by randomly sampling $x$ loci and counting the number of observed
MLGs. This repeated $r$ times for 1 locus up to $n-1$ loci, creating $n-1$
distributions of observed MLGs.

The following code example demonstrates the genotype accumulation curve for data
from @everhart2014fine showing that these data reach a small plateau and have a
greatly decreased variance with 12 markers, indicating that there are enough
markers such that adding more markers to the analysis will not create very many
new genotypes (Fig. \@ref(fig:moniliniacurve)). 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cap <- "Genotype accumulation curve for 694 isolates of the peach brown rot
pathogen, *Monilinia fructicola* genotyped over 13 loci from @everhart2014fine.
The horizontal axis represents the number of loci randomly sampled without
replacement up to *n - 1* loci, the vertical axis shows the number of multilocus
genotypes observed, up to 262, the number of unique multilocus genotypes in the
data set. The red dashed line represents 90% of the total observed multilocus
genotypes. A trendline (blue) has been added using the *ggplot2* function
`stat_smooth`."

set.seed(20150428);
genotype_curve(monpop, sample = 1000);
p <- last_plot() + theme_bw();   # get the last plot
p + geom_smooth(aes(group = 1)); # plot with a trendline
```

### Index of association

The index of association ($I_A$) is a measure of multilocus linkage
disequilibrium that is most often used to detect clonal reproduction within
organisms that have the ability to reproduce via sexual or asexual processes
[@brown1980multilocus; @smith1993how; @milgroom1996recombination]. It was
standardized in 2001 as $\bar{r}_d$ by @Agapow_2001 to address the issue of
scaling with increasing number of loci. This metric is typically applied to
traditional dominant and co-dominant markers such as AFLPs, SNPs, or
microsatellite markers. With the advent of high throughput sequencing, SNP data
is now available in a genome-wide context and in very large matrices including
thousands of SNPs. For this reason, we  devised two approaches using the index
of association for large numbers of markers typical for population genomic
studies. Both functions utilize *adegenet*'s "genlight" object class, which
efficiently stores 8 binary alleles in a single byte [@jombart2011adegenet]. As
calculation of the $\bar{r}_d$ requires distance matrices of absolute number of
differences, we utilize a function that calculates these distances directly from
the compressed data called `bitwise.dist`.

The first approach is a sliding window analysis implemented in the function
`win.ia`. It utilizes the position of markers in the genome to calculate
$\bar{r}_d$ among any number of SNPs found within a user-specified windowed
region. It is important that this calculation utilize $\bar{r}_d$ as the number
of loci will be different within each window [@Agapow_2001]. This approach would
be suited for a quick calculation of linkage disequilibrium across the genome
that can detect potential hotspots of LD that could be investigated further with
more computationally intensive methods assuming that the number of samples <<
the number of loci.

As it would necessarily focus on loci within a short section of the genome that
may or may not be recombining, a sliding window approach would not be good for
utilizing $\bar{r}_d$ as a test for clonal reproduction. A remedy for this is
implemented in the function `samp.ia`, which will randomly sample $m$ loci,
calculate $\bar{r}_d$, and repeat $r$ times, thus creating a distribution of
expected values of $\bar{r}_d$.

To demonstrate the sliding window and random sampling of $\bar{r}_d$ with
respect to clonal populations, we simulated two populations containing 1,100
neutral SNPs for 100 diploid individuals under the same initial seed. One
population had individuals randomly sampled with replacement, representing the
clonal population. After sampling, both populations had 5% random error and 1%
missing data independently propagated across all samples. On average, we
obtained a higher value of $\bar{r}_d$ for the clonal population compared to the
sexual population for both methods (Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure-6)).

### Data format updates: population strata and hierarchies

Assessments of population structure through methods such as hierarchical
$F_{st}$ [@goudet2005hierfstat] and AMOVA [@michalakis1996generic] require
hierarchical sampling of populations across space or time [@linde2002population;
@everhart2014fine; @grunwald2006hierarchical]. With clonal organisms, basic
practice has been to clone-censor data to avoid downward bias in diversity due
to duplicated genotypes that may or may not represent different samples
[@milgroom1996recombination]. This correction should be performed with respect
to a population hierarchy to accurately reflect the biology of the organism.
Traditional data structures for population genetic data in most analysis tools
allow for only one level of hierarchical definition. The investigator thus had
to provide the data set for analysis at each hierarchical level.

To facilitate handling hierarchical and mutlilocus genotypic metadata, *poppr*
version 1.1 introduced a new S4 data object called "genclone", extending
*adegenet*'s "genind" object (Kamvar and Grünwald, unpublished). The genclone
object formalized the definitions of multilocus genotypes and population
hierarchies by adding two slots called "mlg" and "hierarchy" that carried a
numeric vector and a data frame, respectively. These new slots allow for
increased efficiency and ease of use by allowing these metadata to travel with
the genetic data. The hierarchy slot in particular contains a data frame where
each column represents a separate hierarchical level. This is then used to set
the population factor of the data by supplying a hierarchical formula containing
one or more column names of the data frame in the hierarchy slot.

The functionality represented by the hierarchy slot has now been migrated from
the  *poppr* to the *adegenet* package version 2.0 to allow hierarchical
analysis in *adegenet*, *poppr*, and other dependent packages. The prior *poppr*
`hierarchy` slot and methods have now been renamed `strata` in *adegenet*. A
short example of the utility of these methods can be seen in the code segment
under **Bootstrapping**, above. This migration provides end users with a broader
ability to analyze data hierarchically in R across packages.

## Availability

As of this writing, the *poppr* R package version 2.0 containing all of the
features described here is located at
https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/tree/2.0-rc. It is necessary to install
*adegenet* 2.0 before installing *poppr*. It can be found at
https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet. Both of these can be installed via
the R package *devtools* [@wickham2015devtools]. More information and example
code can be found in the supplementary materials[^1].

### Requirements

 - R version 3.0 or better
 - A C compiler. For windows, it can be obtained via Rtools
   (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). On OSX, it can be obtained
   via Xcode. For parallel support, gcc version 4.6 or better is needed.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
cat(beaverdown::iflatex("\\newpage"))
```

### Installation

From within R, *poppr* can be installed via:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("thibautjombart/adegenet")
install_github("grunwaldlab/poppr@2.0-rc")
```

Several population genetics packages in R are currently going through a major
upgrade following the 2015 R hackathon on population genetics
(https://github.com/NESCent/r-popgen-hackathon) and have not yet been updated
in CRAN. We will upload *poppr* 2.0 to CRAN once all other reverse dependent
packages have been updated.

## Discussion

Given low cost and high throughput of current sequencing technologies we are
entering a new era of population genetics where large SNP data sets with
thousands of markers are becoming available for large populations in a genome-
wide context. This data provides new possibilities and challenges for population
genetic analyses. We provide novel tools that enable analysis of this data in R
with a particular emphasis on clonal organisms.

Particularly useful is the implementation of $\bar{r}_d$ in a genomic context
[@Agapow_2001]. Random sampling of loci across the genome can give an expected
distribution of $\bar{r}_d$, which is expected to have a mean of zero for
panmictic populations. This metric is not affected by the number of loci
sampled, is model free, and has the ability to detect population structure.
$\bar{r}_d$ is also implemented for sliding window analyses that are useful to
detect candidate regions of linkage disequilibrium for further analysis.

Clustering multilocus genotypes into multilocus lineages based on genetic
distances is a non-trivial task given large SNP data sets. Moreover, this has
not previously been implemented for genomic data for clonal populations. Clonal
assignment has previously been available in the programs \textsc{GenClone} and
\textsc{Genodive} for classical markers [@arnaud2007standardizing;
@meirmans2004genotype]. Our method with `mlg.filter` builds upon this idea and
allows the user to choose between three different approaches for clustering
MLGs. The choice of clustering algorithm has an impact on the data (Fig.
\@ref(fig:Figure1), \@ref(fig:Figure-2)), where for example a genetic distance
cutoff of 0.1 would be the difference between 14 multilocus lineages (MLLs) and
17 MLLs for nearest neighbor and UPGMA clustering, respectively (Fig.
\@ref(fig:Figure-2)). The option to choose the clustering algorithm gives the
user the ability to choose what is biologically relevant to their populations.
While there is not one optimal procedure for defining boundaries in clonal
lineages, our tool provides a means of exploring the potential MLG or MLL
boundary space.

Minimum spanning networks are a useful tool to analyze the relationships between
individuals in a population, because it reduces the complexity of a distance
matrix to the connections that are strongest. By default, these networks are
drawn without reticulations, but for clonal organisms where many of the
connections between samples are equivalent, the minimum spanning network appears
as a chain and reduces the information that can be communicated. This is
problematic because the ability to detect population structure with one instance
of a minimum spanning network is limited. Adding reticulation into the minimum
spanning network thus presents all equivalent connections and allows population
structure to be more readily detectable. As shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:Figure-3),
population structure is apparent both visually and by graph community detection
algorithms such as the infoMAP algorithm [@rosvall2008maps]. Additionally, the
current implementation in *poppr* has been successfully used in analyses such as
reconstruction of the *P. ramorum* epidemic in Oregon forests

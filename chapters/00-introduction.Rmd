# Introduction

<!-- NIK
INTRO Paragraph: Plant pathogens evolve ... adapt to crops ... udnerstnaindg evolutiona nd population dynamics is useful ... HEnce your work .. focuisng on Phytophthora and tool development. The objectives of my work were thus two-fold and included (1) development of computational tools to characterize populations and (2) application of these tools to populations of the plant pathogen genus *Phytophthora*.

ZHIAN 

I put this as a comment since it's a guideline
 -->
## Population genetics of clonal organisms

Clonal populations are a special case ...

## The Genus *Phytophthora*

<!-- ZHIAN

please note, This will not be the final draft. I took this from my project
proposal and plan to rework it.

 -->

The genus *Phytophthora*, translating to "plant destroyer" in Greek, contains
over 100 species [@kroon2012genus], many of which have significant impact on US
agriculture. *P. sojae* is a major problem on soybean, causing $1-2 billion in
losses each year [@tyler2007phytophthora]. *P. ramorum* is changing the
landscape of the North American West due to its wide host range
[@grunwald2008phytophthora], which results in devastating losses for the US
forestry and nursery industries. And *P. infestans*, which was a root cause of
over a million deaths during the Irish Potato Famine and continues to be a
problem on tomato and potato crops, resulting in losses exceeding $6 billion,
annually [@haas2009genome]. *Phytophthora spp.* are water molds characterized by
production of oospores and biflagellate zoospores that place them into the
Stramenopiles [@baldauf2003deep]. They are most closely related to golden brown
algae and quite diverged from fungi. 

<!-- NIK
This might better be ina  separate section. 
Since your dissertation does not include effector work, this is not crucial howevever.
If you decide to incldue maker sure you explain what effectors are incldue the PAMP amnd MAMP and PTI concepts, etc.
RXLR are not the only effectors. CRN and others are also important.

ZHIAN 

See the note above. This was a copy/paste from my original project proposal. 
I said that I would re-work it. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "if you decide to include maker"? Are you
referring to the software? 

-->

One of the distinguishing molecular
characteristics of *Phytophthora spp.* are the presence of effector proteins
with an RxLR motif. These proteins are necessary to confer virulence against the
host and they are under extreme diversifying selection within species
[@haas2009genome; @yoshida2013rise].

<!-- NIK

include a figures such as: phylogenetic placement, morphologial fatures,  life cycle, sexual cycle, GBS

 -->

### life cycle

### Sex and mating types

### Heterothallic, clonal: *P. ramorum*

 - Sudden Oak Death
 - Population genetics in US nurseries [@goss2009population]

### Homothallic, partially clonal: *P. syringae*

 - Abundant in OR Nurseries (found in foliar isolates) [@parke2014phytophthora]
 - Genetic structure uncharacterized

## Tools for analysis of clonal population genetics

Recommendations have been made for analysis [@arnaud2007standardizing]

 - MLG diversity
 - Genotype Accumulation Curve
 - $P_{sex}$ and $P_{gen}$

### Index of Association

 - Standardized Version [@Agapow_2001]
 - Previous Simulation Analyses [@de2004clonal]
 - What's missing
 	- Sympatric clonal lineages
 	- Analysis of significance testing
 	- HTS markers

### Software Limitations

Plethora of tools, most designed for sexual populations except:

 - GenClone
 - GenoDive

Problems with file formatting, time, and reproducibility.

### poppr

 - R
 - poppr

<!-- NIK

I am not sure intrdocuing poppr ehre is a good idea. This is the result f chapter 2?

ZHIAN

I believe it was in the right place until things were moved around :P In any
case, Currently the structure of this does not match the structure that we 
discussed. I believe more discussion is needed to resolve this. 

ZHIAN

I've moved things around a bit in a way that makes sense to me. Again, we can
discuss this.
 -->

## Applications of novel tools for analysis of partially-clonal populations

 - Simulation analysis of $\bar{r}_d$
 - SSR analysis of *P. ramorum*
 - GBS analysis of *P. syringae*

## Conclusion

<!-- ZHIAN this will prime the order of the chapters -->

- Open Source Scientific Software Development of Poppr
	- Related tools
- Simulation Analysis
- Pop gen info for two *Phytophthoras*
  - Major results of your work in 2-4 sentences ...

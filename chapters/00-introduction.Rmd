The objectives of my work were two-fold and included 

 1. development of computational tools to characterize populations and 
 2. application of these tools to populations of the plant pathogen genus
    *Phytophthora*.

## The Genus *Phytophthora*

<!-- NIK

include a figures such as: phylogenetic placement, morphologial fatures,  life cycle, sexual cycle, GBS

 -->

### life cycle

### Sex and mating types

### Population genetics

## Marker systems

- SSR
- GBS and SNPs
- reference genome of P. syringae ... <!-- ZHIAN Are we allowed to publish this? -->



### *P. ramorum*

 - Sudden Oak Death

### *P. syringae*

 - Abundant in OR Nurseries (found in foliar isolates) [@parke2014phytophthora]


### Examples of pop gen from Phytophthora


## Population genetics of clonal organisms


Clonal populations are a special case ...

## Tools for analysis of clonal population genetics

### The past

Plethora of tools, most designed for sexual populations except:

 - GenClone
 - GenoDive

Problems with file formatting, time, and reproducibility.

### Introduce R as a great toolbox

### The present

poppr

<!-- NIK

I am not sure intrdocuing poppr ehre is a good idea. This is the result f chapter 2?

ZHIAN

I believe it was in the right place until things were moved around :P In any
case, Currently the structure of this does not match the structure that we 
discussed. I believe more discussion is needed to resolve this. 

 -->

### Conclusion

- Open soruces nature of poppr.
- Related tools:
  - adegeent
  - pegas
  - etc.
- Pop gen info for two Phytophthoras
  - Major results of your work in 2-4 sentences ...

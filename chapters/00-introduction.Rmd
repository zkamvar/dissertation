# Introduction

Dobzhansky's famous quote "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light
of evolution" has become a cliché, but it is hard to find a statement that more elegantly 
captures the essence of biological study [-@dobzhansky2013nothing]. In a more
reductionist sense, it is perhaps appropriate to state that nothing in evolution
makes sense except in the light of mutation; that is to say that mutation in an
organism's genetic code is the seed upon which evolution acts
[@lynch2016genetic]. Of course, a seed left alone will not grow; it needs the
right environment and conditions. In turn, a mutation needs a population
in order to thrive. A population can be defined as a group of interbreeding 
individuals, coexisting temporally and spatially (though we will see later that
this is not always the best definition) [@milgroom1997contributions]. In a
population, if the conditions are right, a new mutation can grow in frequency and
become an established allele. The study of population genetics seeks to
understand how evolution acts upon these alleles to shape populations as they
grow, shrink, split, and adapt to their environment. Ultimately, these
populations are what give rise to species.

## Population Genetics and Clonality

The classical definition of a population is reliant upon the assumption
that the individuals within the populations are panmictic, that is that they are
randomly mating so that the individuals in the next generation will have a
random assortment of alleles inherited from their parents [@rice2002evolution;
@nielsen2013introduction; @hartl1997principles]. The assumption that sex occurs applies to most major organismal groups
[@rice2002evolution; @heitman2012evolution]. However, sex does not occur in all organisms as many plants, fungi, protists, bacteria,
animals, and viruses are known to exclusively reproduce clonally
[@rice2002evolution; @heitman2012evolution; @arnaud2012implications; 
@orive1993effective; @arnaud2007standardizing]. Clonal reproduction here means
reproduction that results in offspring that are genetically identical to the
parents (note that this can include organisms derived from the selfing of a haploid
organism). Thus, the definition of a population is perhaps best rephrased to
simply indicate a group of individuals of the same species^[This depends on your definition of a species, which is out of the scope of this dissertation and therefore best debated elsewhere.] coexisting
spatially and temporally [@milgroom1997contributions]. 

There are several costs and benefits associated with both clonal and sexual
reproductive strategies from an evolutionary perspective. For organisms whose main
mode of reproduction is sexual, there is the two-fold cost of outcrossing: 1)
only half of the available genetic material is inherited by the offspring and 2)
the loss of advantageous gene combinations due to recombination
[@rice2002evolution; @heitman2012evolution;
@nieuwenhuis2016frequency]. These costs are balanced by the benefits that come
with recombining genetic material, which allows these organisms to purge
deleterious mutations. As clonally reproducing organisms do not undergo regular
periods of recombination, they explicitly do not benefit from the previously
mentioned advantage of recombination [@heitman2012evolution;
@nieuwenhuis2016frequency]. This leads to a theory known as Muller's ratchet,
which indicates that the overall fitness of small populations of clonally
reproducing organisms will decrease over time as the number of deleterious
mutations accumulate, eventually leading to extinction
[@felsenstein1974evolutionary; @loewe2006quantifying; @lynch1993mutational;
@lynch1990mutation]. Despite this, clonal organisms still have the advantage of
passing on 100% of their genetic material to the next generation.

It's easy to see the advantage of both of these strategies in the context of 
genetic adaptation to the environment. Clonal populations that are well adapted to
their environment get to keep the combination of genes that allowed them to be so
well adapted [@heitman2012evolution]. This strategy provides an advantage when
resources are scarce and competition is high, but does not lend itself well to
adaptation against changing environments due to low genotypic diversity 
[@milgroom1996recombination]. Conversely, while sexual populations lose the 
competitive advantage of conserved beneficial allelic combinations, they make up for it with
high genotypic diversity, increasing the chances of surviving change in
the environment. As we shall see in the following sections, many microbial
pathogens have the ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually
[@tibayrenc1995population; @anderson1995clonality; @milgroom1996recombination].

The question of sexual reproduction and population structure in microbial 
pathogens is important for the development of rational management strategies for pathogens or beneficial microbes [@tibayrenc1990clonal;
@tibayrenc1995population; @milgroom1997contributions; @taylor1999evolutionary].
If one were developing an antimicrobial agent on a known set of strains, the 
effectiveness of this agent will be diminished if these strains represent only
a fraction of the genotypic diversity due to sexual recombination
[@taylor1999evolutionary; @tibayrenc1990clonal; @smith1993how]. Since most
inference of population structure is based on neutral models that assume sexual
reproduction, it is important to identify whether or not the population in 
question is reproducing sexually or clonally before one attempts to assess 
population structure and infer evolutionary processes [@tibayrenc1990clonal]. 

Neutral molecular markers are commonly used for population genetic analyses.
Before molecular techniques became widely available for characterization of
pathogens or microbes, the variation within most pathogenic microorganisms was
described using phenotypic traits that reflected their pathogenicity (ability to
cause disease), virulence (severity of disease), or morphotype placing them into
different phenotypes [@milgroom1997contributions; @levin1999population]. When 
considering markers for population genetic analysis, one of the most important
criteria is that these markers are heritable.

A wide variety of heritable molecular markers exist for population genetic analysis [@tibayrenc1995population;
@halkett2005tackling]. It is not necessary to expound here on the variety of
molecular markers available to us, but it is useful to take note of the common
features. Generally, genetic markers come in two major flavors, selectively neutral and
selected markers [@milgroom1997contributions; @mcdonald1997population; 
@tibayrenc1995population]. Selectively neutral markers are used as independent
variables that can reflect the evolutionary history of descent. For selectively
neutral markers, it is important that they be independent and unlinked within
the genome [@mcdonald1997population]. 

Because neutral genetic markers vary independently within a population, these
are more appropriate than selected markers to detect sexual reproduction. The
theory behind this is simple; sexual reproduction breaks up associations between
markers due to recombination and independent, random assortment. This contrasts with clonal reproduction, which
transfers the entire genome in tact to the next generation, preserving 
associations [@orive1993effective; @heitman2012evolution; 
@nieuwenhuis2016frequency; @mcdonald1997population; @milgroom1997contributions;
@tibayrenc1995population]. This means that not only will there be significant
associations between alleles in a clonal population, but because of their
inability to purge mutations, we also expect to see excess heterozygosity
[@tibayrenc1990clonal; @tibayrenc1996towards].

By using these basic principles, core sets of statistical analyses have been
proposed to detect sexual reproduction by analyzing diversity within loci (for
diploid organisms), linkage among loci, and diversity of multi-locus genotypes
within the population [@tibayrenc1996towards; @arnaud2007standardizing; 
@parks1993study; @smith1993how; @mcdonald1997population; @grunwald2003analysis].
None of these tests alone can give a definitive answer as to the nature of 
reproduction in a given population [@tibayrenc1995population; @de2004clonal; 
@nieuwenhuis2016frequency]. Researchers still need to use biological evidence,
such as the observation of sexual reproductive structures, to support the 
presence of sex.

## Population Genetics Under the Lens of Plant Pathology

One of the over-arching themes in both ecology and evolution is that diversity
is important for stable population and community structure
[@magurran1988diversity; @mcdonald2002pathogen]. Agricultural systems, however,
behave very differently to natural ecosystems [@milgroom1997contributions;
@stukenbrock2008origins]. Within agricultural systems, the plants and the
landscape are homogenized, providing a steady source of food for people, but
this homogeneity combined with intensive management practices also provides
fertile ground for the evolution of plant pathogens [@stukenbrock2008origins].
McDonald identified five major factors influencing the evolution of plant
pathogens in agricultural systems: 1) mutation, 2) genetic drift, 3)
gene/genotype flow, 4) mating system, and 5) selection due to host resistance
[-@mcdonald2002pathogen].

An example of how changing one of these five factors influences plant health is
clear in the oomycete *Phytophthora infestans* (Mont.) de Bary. The causal agent
of potato late blight (and a poster child for plant pathology). *P. infestans* has
changed the very demographics of human populations across the Atlantic ocean due
to its role in the Irish potato famine [@erwin1996phytophthora]. It has a
heterothallic (no selfing) life cycle that includes both clonally and sexually
derived infectious propagules (Fig.\@ref(fig:pinflife)). The clonally derived
propagules are swimming, short-lived zoospores that can be transmitted via wind
or water, whereas the sexually derived propagules are double-walled oospores.
While *P. infestans* can survive as hyphae in infected tubers, the sexually
derived oospores can survive for years in the soil, highlighting the added risk
presented by sexual reproduction.

```

From the time of the Great Famine to 1980, there was only one single mating
type, A1, observed in Europe, indicating that it was reproducing in a strictly
clonal fashion [@goodwin1994panglobal]. Sexual reproduction became possible when
the second mating type, A2, was introduced to Europe [@galindo1960nature]. Because of this risk, population
genetic tools and methods were needed to assess whether or not sexual
reproduction had occurred. While evidence for sexual reproduction was found
[@sujkowski1994increased], it additionally appeared that *P. infestans* was
still reproducing and spreading clonally [@goodwin1994panglobal].
@cooke2012genome analyzed isolates from 1983 to 2008 and found a rapid shift in
clonal population structure, showing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of a
particularly aggressive lineage. While sexual reproduction was not found to be
prevalent, it was only via population genetic techniques that this question
could be addressed.

## The Need For Reproducible Research

Computational methods are increasingly important for answering questions
crucial to plant pathology, and as more and more of our analyses are becoming
computational in nature, we need to ensure that these methods are
reproducible. Computational methods are crucial for population genetic analyses
in the 21st century [@excoffier2006computer]. There has been a call for
standards in the analysis of clonal organisms for the past twenty years, which
resulted in a plethora of computer programs [@tibayrenc1996towards;
@arnaud2007standardizing]. It was not uncommon for a researcher to use several
programs to answer a single research question, and each program would often
require its own custom input format and would not necessarily run on all
operating systems [@excoffier2006computer; @kamvar2014poppr]. The constant
reformatting of data, and the inability to automate series of analyses made it
not only challenging to communicate the methods, but also increased the chance
for error [@excoffier2006computer; @adamack2014popgenreport; @kamvar2014poppr; 
@goecks2010galaxy].

Biologists often think about reproducibility in terms of wet lab or bench work.
Care is taken to ensure that all methods and data are faithfully recorded in a
lab notebook, but this is not necessarily extended to computational analyses.
The concept of reproducible research in scientific computing is attempting to
take the principles of reproducibility we use in the wet lab and extend them to
our downstream analyses in silico. This work attempts to introduce tools for reproducible
research in clonal population genetics in an open manner. When researchers have
open tools that can be easily shared, they can spend more time asking questions
and less time formatting data.

The work presented here offers tools designed to answer questions related to
clonal population genetics and plant pathology (Fig. \@ref(fig:introduction1)).
In this context, the term 'tool' refers to software code used to apply
mathematical models or theory to population genetic data. The merit of this work
lies within the context of reproducible science, which ensures that the
computational environment used to create results can be replicated
[@buckheit1995wavelab]. The end goal was not simply the development of the
software, but rather, the development of software for the goal of analyzing our
own data. Serendipitously, by analyzing our own data with this software, we are
able to not only demonstrate that it can be used, but also demonstrate that an
entire analysis can be conducted in an open and reproducible manner. We
demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of these tools by using them to show
evidence for multiple introductions in the Curry County, OR outbreak of the
sudden oak death pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*. We additionally assess the
power of the multilocus linkage disequilibrium measure $\bar{r}_d$ to detect
clonal reproduction.

### Summary of Chapter 2

To address the lack of tools for reproducible research in clonal population
genetics, we present the software package *poppr* in the R computing language
[@R2016; @kamvar2014poppr]. Previously, tools necessary for the analysis of clonal
populations were available in several stand-alone software programs, each
requiring different data input formats. Moreover, each program had different
levels of documentation and limited support for all computing platforms. The
novelty of *poppr* was to introduce indices of multilocus genotypic diversity,
the index of association, and a fast implementation of Bruvo's genetic distance,
and clone-correction over unlimited levels of user-specified population hierarchies
[@arnaud2007standardizing; @Agapow_2001; @bruvo2004simple]. Because this was
implemented in R these analyses can be performed in a reproducible manner on
all computing platforms. 

### Summary of Chapter 3

The initial implementation of *poppr* contained basic tools for analysis of
clonal populations [@kamvar2014poppr], but lacked tools for custom definitions
of multilocus genotypes and performed poorly with genomic-scale data. Chapter 3
introduces an updated and improved *poppr* version 2.0. With high throughput
sequencing (HTS) data, the amount of missing data and genotyping error
increases, and the definition of a multilocus genotype becomes unclear.
Moreover, the calculation of the index of association scales poorly with an
increase in the number of loci. To address these limitations, we improved *poppr*
with new functionalities to define multilocus genotypes based on genetic
distance and calculate the index of association over random samples or windows
of SNP loci.



### Summary of Chapter 4

A newly-emerged disease of oak---called Sudden Oak Death---spread from
California to the Southwest corner of Oregon in 2001. Because of intense
management strategies, the epidemic was largely contained to Curry county for
the next 15 years. In 2011, an isolated patch of disease appeared in Cape
Sebastian, 12 miles from the nearest infected site. With microsatellite
genotyping performed across 2 labs and 15 years, we sought to describe the
spread of the epidemic in a population genetic context and ask the question of
whether or not there was evidence for more than one introduction event. 
This work provided evidence supporting at least two introductions to Curry county forests. All the
analyses were performed in an open-source and reproducible manner using R.

### Summary of Chapter 5

The index of association is a measure of multilocus linkage disequilibrium, that
is, a correlation coefficient across multiple loci. In sexual populations, loci
are randomly assorting due to recombination, resulting in a near-zero value of
the index of association. In clonal populations, recombination is non-existent,
meaning that loci are passed from parent to offspring in a non-independent
fashion, resulting in a significantly non-zero value of the index of
association. De Meeûs & Balloux [-@de2004clonal] demonstrated that this index shows high variance with
low levels of sexual reproduction, but due to limitations in software, they were not
able to perform power analyses. We used *poppr* to investigate the power of the
index of association to detect sexual reproduction in simulated data sets
generated with microsatellite and genomic markers. This chapter provides novel
insights on the power, sensitivity, and scope of the index of association.

# Introduction

<!-- NIK
INTRO Paragraph: Plant pathogens evolve ... adapt to crops ... udnerstnaindg evolutiona nd population dynamics is useful ... HEnce your work .. focuisng on Phytophthora and tool development. The objectives of my work were thus two-fold and included (1) development of computational tools to characterize populations and (2) application of these tools to populations of the plant pathogen genus *Phytophthora*.

I put this as a comment since it's a guideline
 -->

 - Plant Pathogens 
 	- Evolution and Adaptation
 	- Understanding clonal population dynamics (*Phytophthora* and *Zymoseptoria* examples)
 - Tools for analysis
 	- Tools for clonal populations always come after sexual populations
 	- We wrote our own tools
 - Goals of my work
 	1. development of computational tools to characterize populations
 	2. application of these tools to address empirical and theoretical questions


## Population genetics of clonal organisms

 - Population genetics is traditionally centered around HWE
 - Clonal populations violate basic statistical inference
 	- non-independent samples (clones)
 	- excess heterozygosity
 	- Meselson effect [@balloux2003population; @butlin2000virgin;
 	  @welch2000evidence; @welch2001rates]

## The Genus *Phytophthora*

<!-- ZHIAN

please note, This will not be the final draft. I took this from my project
proposal and plan to rework it.

 -->

The genus *Phytophthora*, translating to "plant destroyer" in Greek, contains
over 100 species [@kroon2012genus], many of which have significant impact on US
agriculture. *P. sojae* is a major problem on soybean, causing $1-2 billion in
losses each year [@tyler2007phytophthora]. *P. ramorum* is changing the
landscape of the North American West due to its wide host range
[@grunwald2008phytophthora], which results in devastating losses for the US
forestry and nursery industries. And *P. infestans*, which was a root cause of
over a million deaths during the Irish Potato Famine and continues to be a
problem on tomato and potato crops, resulting in losses exceeding $6 billion,
annually [@haas2009genome]. *Phytophthora spp.* are water molds characterized by
production of oospores and biflagellate zoospores that place them into the
Stramenopiles [@baldauf2003deep]. They are most closely related to golden brown
algae and quite diverged from fungi. 

<!-- NIK

include a figures such as: phylogenetic placement, morphologial fatures, life cycle, sexual cycle, GBS

 -->

### life cycle

### Sex and mating types

### Heterothallic, clonal: *P. ramorum*

 - Sudden Oak Death
 - Population genetics in US nurseries [@goss2009population]

### Homothallic, partially clonal: *P. syringae*

 - Abundant in OR Nurseries (found in foliar isolates) [@parke2014phytophthora]
 - Genetic structure uncharacterized

## Tools for analysis of clonal population genetics

Recommendations have been made for analysis [@arnaud2007standardizing]

 - MLG diversity
 - Genotype Accumulation Curve
 - $P_{sex}$ and $P_{gen}$

### Index of Association

 - Standardized Version [@Agapow_2001]
 - Previous Simulation Analyses [@de2004clonal]
 - What's missing
 	- Sympatric clonal lineages
 	- Analysis of significance testing
 	- HTS markers

### Software Limitations

Plethora of tools, most designed for sexual populations except:

 - GenClone
 - GenoDive

Problems with file formatting, time, and reproducibility.

### poppr

 - R
 - poppr

## Applications of novel tools for analysis of partially-clonal populations

 - Simulation analysis of $\bar{r}_d$
 - SSR analysis of *P. ramorum*
 - GBS analysis of *P. syringae*

## Conclusion

<!-- ZHIAN this will prime the order of the chapters -->

- Open Source Scientific Software Development of Poppr
	- Related tools
- Simulation Analysis
- Pop gen info for two *Phytophthoras*
  - Major results of your work in 2-4 sentences ...

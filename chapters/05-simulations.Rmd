## Abstract

The index of association is a measure of multilocus linkage disequilibrium,
which reflects the deviation of observed genetic variation from expected. In
sexual populations, loci are randomly assorting due to recombination, resulting
in a near-zero value of the index of association. In clonal populations,
recombination is non-existent, meaning that loci are passed from parent to
offspring in a non-independent fashion, resulting in a significantly non-zero
value of the index of association. We build on previous work by investigating
the effect of sample size, mutation rate, and clone correction on the power of
the index of association to detect clonal reproduction in simulated data sets
generated with microsatellite and genomic markers. Our findings suggest that
power decreases with small sample sizes and low allelic diversity, and physical
linkage in genomic markers does not affect power if permutation tests are
performed with linkage groups. We hope that these novel insights provide useful
to the study of molecular pathogens.

## Introduction

Population genetic theory is largely based on model populations such as the
neutral Wright-Fisher model in which populations are assumed to be infinitely
large, with discrete generations, randomly assorting alleles, with no migration
and no mutation [@hartl1997principles; @nielsen2013introduction]. By using such
reductionist models, population geneticists are able to reduce the complexity
and enable analyses to ask fundamental questions and test hypotheses about
evolutionary processes that could explain population structure and history.

These neutral models, however, cannot be applied to populations whose life
history violate the fundamental assumption of random assortment of alleles, such
as populations that undergo clonal reproduction [@orive1993effective;
@milgroom1996recombination]. For many clonal populations, the contribution of
genetic variation from mutation is greater than that of recombination. While
this increases the risk of the accumulation of deleterious mutations, the 
two-fold cost of sex is drastically reduced, meaning that selectively
advantageous combinations of alleles are maintained [@heitman2012evolution].

Pathogenic microorganisms can reproduce sexually or clonally
[@tibayrenc1996towards; @milgroom1996recombination]. Diseases caused by these
organisms are in part managed by the use of antimicrobial compounds that kill
these organisms. Detecting recombination in populations of pathogenic
microorganisms is therefore important for the implementation of rational
management strategies as a prevalence of sexual reproduction could lead to the
repeated emergence of novel, resistant genotypes [@smith1993how;
@milgroom1996recombination; @goss2014irish; @de2006molecular; 
@nieuwenhuis2016frequency].


Several studies have attempted to infer the degree of sex in populations that
undergo clonal reproduction [@smith1993how; @balloux2003population; 
@de2004clonal; @ali2016cloncase; @nieuwenhuis2016frequency]. For populations
with well-defined sexual and clonal phases occurring at separate times, such as
rust fungi, methods like *CloNcaSe* are effective for estimating the rate of
sexual reproduction and effective population size [@ali2016cloncase]. However,
this method cannot be applied to populations where the reproductive cycle is not
partitioned into discrete generations.

Simply detecting the presence of clonal reproduction, however can be useful in
and of itself [@milgroom1996recombination]. A method commonly used to assess
this is the index of association ($I_A$), and its standardized version,
$\bar{r}_d$, which measure multilocus linkage disequilibrium
[@brown1980multilocus; @smith1993how; @haubold1998detecting; @Agapow_2001;
@de2004clonal; @kamvar2014poppr]. The value of $I_A$, as shown in equation
\@ref(eq:ia), is measured as the ratio of observed variance ($V_O$) and expected
variance ($V_E$) in genetic distance between samples [@smith1993how;
@Agapow_2001]:

\begin{equation}
I_A = \frac{V_O}{V_E} - 1 (\#eq:ia)
\end{equation}

The expected variance is practically modeled as the sum of the variances over
*m* loci: $V_E = \sum^m{var_j}$ [@Agapow_2001; @haubold1998detecting]. If the
differences between samples are randomly distributed (linkage equilibrium), we
can expect the value of $I_A$ to be zero [@smith1993how; @Agapow_2001]. Under
scenarios of non-random mating (e.g. population structure or clonal
reproduction), the observed variance would be greater than the expected variance
due to a multi-modal distribution of distances, and $I_A$ would be greater than
zero [@smith1993how; @Agapow_2001; @milgroom2015population]. @Agapow_2001 noted
that this metric does not have an upper limit and increases with the number of
loci. To correct this, they developed $\bar{r}_d$ (equation \@ref(eq:rd)), which
has a similar structure to a correlation coefficient and ranges from 0 (no
linkage) to 1 (complete linkage):

\begin{align} % This mode aligns the equations to the '&=' signs
\begin{split} % This mode groups the equations into one.
\bar{r}_d &= \frac{\sum\sum{cov_{j,k}}}{
                   \sum\sum{\sqrt{var_{j} \cdot var_{k}}}} \\
          &= \frac{V_O - V_E}{2\sum\sum{\sqrt{var_{j} \cdot var_{k}}}}
\end{split}
(\#eq:rd)
\end{align}

De Meeûx & Balloux [-@de2004clonal] investigated the effect of increasing levels
of sexual reproduction on $\bar{r}_d$ (noted in their publication as
$\bar{r}_D$). They found that very little ($\sim$ 1%) sexual reproduction is
required to produce a value of $\bar{r}_d$ close to zero. This indicates that
$\bar{r}_d$ alone might not be well suited as a measure of clonal reproduction.
@prugnolle2010apparent tested the effect of sampling design on $\bar{r}_d$,
finding that its value is drastically reduced when clones from multiple
populations are sampled, leading to an over-estimation of the level of
recombination.

These studies laid the groundwork for understanding the behavior of $\bar{r}_d$
under different scenarios of non-random mating in diploid organisms, but there
were some limitations in available technology. For both studies, the only
software available for calculation of $\bar{r}_d$ for diploid organisms was
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Multilocus</span>, which could only take
one data set at a time [@Agapow_2001; @de2004clonal; @prugnolle2010apparent;
@kamvar2014poppr]. This constrained researchers to only analyze a minimal set of
20 populations per scenario.

A non-zero value of $I_A$ and $\bar{r}_d$ does not always indicate a significant
departure from the null assumption of unlinked loci. Since the distribution of
$I_A$ and $\bar{r}_d$ are not known, the safest way to test for significance are
random permutation tests. These tests effectively create unlinked populations by
shuffling individuals at each locus, independently and re-calculating $I_A$ and
$\bar{r}_d$ [@smith1993how; @Agapow_2001; @haubold1998detecting]. An upper 
one-sided test of significance is then used to see if the observed statistic is
greater than the observed distribution. 

Standard practice for analyzing microbial populations is to perform this test on
both the whole data set (wd) and clone-corrected data (cc), where each
multilocus genotype is represented only once per population to avoid signatures
of linkage that arise from re-sampling the same individual [@goss2014irish;
@milgroom1996recombination; @mcdonald1997population]. If the p-value for
$\bar{r}_d$ is significant after clone-correction, then the population is
expected to be clonal. While significance testing is available in 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Multilocus</span> in the form of random
permutations, it is computationally expensive, and can only take one data set at
a time [@Agapow_2001; @kamvar2014poppr]. As a result, power analysis of
$\bar{r}_d$ to detect clonal reproduction with and without clone-correction has
not yet been performed [@de2004clonal].

In the years since the studies conducted by @de2004clonal and
@prugnolle2010apparent, reduced-representation, high-throughput sequencing
methods such as Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) and Restriction site associated
DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) have become popular tools for population genetic
analysis [@davey2010rad; @davey2011genome; @elshire2011robust]. These methods
have the capability to generate thousands of unlinked markers at a fraction of
the cost and time necessary to develop high quality microsatellite markers.
These marker systems are also prone to missing data and high error rates
[@mastretta2015restriction]. The index of association was developed for multiple
loci at a time when obtaining even 100 unlinked markers posed a significant
challenge. With the advent of these technologies, it is unclear how marker
choice and genotyping error affect the index of association.

We developed the R package *poppr* for analysis of clonal populations, removing
the limitations of data input and computational expense of analyzing the index
of association [@kamvar2014poppr] and further expanded this to analysis of
genome-wide SNP data [@R2016; @kamvar2015novel]. With these tools we expand on
previous studies by asking how sample size, marker choice, clone-correction, and
the assumption of homogeneous mutation rates affect our ability to detect clonal
reproduction in diploid populations. Our objectives to answer these questions
are to (1) re-analyze $\bar{r}_d$ against increasing rates of sexual
reproduction in both microsatellite and SNP data sets, (2) perform a power
analysis of $\bar{r}_d$ to assess sensitivity and specificity, and (3) assess
how genotypic and allelic evenness and diversity affects $\bar{r}_d$. Because
studies have observed significantly negative values of $I_A$ and $\bar{r}_d$ (p
$\geq$ 0.95), we additionally seek to determine what factors result in negative
$\bar{r}_d$ values. This work provides novel insights into the sensitivity and
scope of the index of association for inferring clonality.

## Methods

We used simulations to evaluate the behavior of $\bar{r}_d$ under different
population scenarios. Initial sets of simulations were created for different
levels of sexual reproduction for each marker type. All simulations were
performed with the python package simuPOP version 1.1.7 in python version 3.4
[@peng2008forward]. For each scenario, 100 simulations with 10 replicates were
created with a census size of 10,000 diploid individuals with equal mating type
proportions evolved over 10,000 generations. We chose a census size of 10,000 
individuals to minimize the effect of drift. We chose to run the simulations for
10,000 generations because this was previously shown in @de2004clonal to be
sufficient in reaching equilibrium for summary statistics.

The simulated populations were first stored in the native simuPOP format and
then transferred to feather format using the python and R packages *feather*
version 0.3.0 for downstream analyses. Microsatellite simulations were performed
on Ubuntu Linux version 14.04; SNP simulations were performed on CentOS Linux
version 6.8. During downstream analysis, 10, 25, 50, and 100 individuals were
sampled without replacement for each replicate in R version 3.2 with the package
*poppr* version 2.3.0 [@R2016;@kamvar2014poppr; @kamvar2015novel]. Analyses
(described below) were performed on both full and clone-corrected data sets. All
downstream analyses were run on the OSU CGRB Core Computing Facility.

### Simulating Microsatellite Loci

Each population was simulated with 21 co-dominant, unlinked loci containing 6 to
10 alleles per locus with frequencies drawn from a uniform distribution and
subsequently normalized so that allele frequencies at each locus sum to one.
We used 6 to 10 alleles per locus as this is the number of alleles commonly used
for population genetic studies to avoid statistical noise. Before mating,
mutations occurred at each locus at a rate of 1e-5 mutations/generation with the
exception of the first locus, at which the mutation rate was set to 1e-3.
The mutation rate of 1e-5 was selected as this was previously used in 
@de2004clonal and is close to the estimated recombination rate of *Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae* microsatellite loci [@lynch2008genome]. All mutations were applied
in a stepwise manner using the `StepwiseMutator()` operator in simuPOP.

### Simulating SNP Loci

Simulations of 10,000 diploid, biallelic loci spread evenly over 10 chromosomal
fragments were simulated with a mutation rate of 1e-5 mutations per generation
for forward and backward mutations using the `SNPMutator()` operator and and a
recombination rate of 0.01 between adjacent loci using the `Recombinator()`
operator in simuPOP.

### Mating

Simulations of sexual reproduction were conducted at 10 rates of sexual
reproduction over a log scale (0.0, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-2, 5e-2, 0.1, 
0.5, 1.0) reflecting the fraction of individuals in generation *t+1* produced
via sexual reproduction. One to three offspring could be produced at each mating
event. Rates were chosen to investigate the dynamics of $\bar{r}_d$ at low
levels of clonal reproduction.   For sexual events, two parents were chosen
randomly from the population with the `RandomSelection()` operator and offspring
genotypes were created via the `MendelianGenoTransmitter()` operator. The clonal
fraction was created by randomly sampling individuals from the population and
duplicating their genotypes with the `CloneGenoTransmitter()` operator. If one
mating type was lost before 10,000 generations, the simulation would continue to
completion with only clonal reproduction.

### Analysis of Microsatellite Data

The standardized index of association ($\bar{r}_d$, @Agapow_2001) was calculated
for full and clone-corrected data using the *poppr* function `ia()`
[@kamvar2014poppr]. Tests for significance were performed by randomly permuting
the alleles at each locus independently and then assessing $\bar{r}_d$. A total
of 999 permutations were conducted for each replicate population to evaluate
statistical support. Analyses were done for both full and clone-corrected data.
The p-values reflect the proportion of observations greater than the observed
statistic. Estimates of genotypic diversity were assessed with the *poppr*
function `diversity_boot()` with 999 bootstrap replicates, recording the
estimate and variance [@kamvar2015novel]. The genotypic diversity statistics we
calculated were Shannon's Index, $H = -\sum p_i ln p_i$
[@shannon2001mathematical], Stoddart and Taylor's Index, $G = 1/\sum p_i^2$
[@stoddart1988genotypic], and Evenness, $E_5 = (G - 1)/(e^H - 1)$
[@pielou1975ecological] where $p_i$ is the frequency of the *i*th genotype. We
additionally calculated Nei's expected heterozygosity, also known as gene
diversity [@Nei:1978], and mean allelic evenness $E_{5A} = (1/m) \sum E_{5l}$,
where *m* is the number of loci and $E_{5l}$ is the evenness of the alleles at
locus *l* with the *poppr* function `locus_table()` [@grunwald2003analysis;
@kamvar2014poppr].


### Analysis of SNP Data

The overall value of $\bar{r}_d$ was calculated for each simulation with the
*poppr* function `bitwise.ia()` [@kamvar2015novel]. Significance was first
assessed by randomly shuffling genotypes at each locus independently and then,
to preserve existing background linkage structure, at each chromosome
independently. This was done 999 times for each replicate population. P-values
represent the proportion of random samples greater than or equal to the observed
statistic.

Because GBS data are associated with high error rates, we additionally wanted to
assess the effect of missing data on analysis. To do this, we used scripts
written for @kamvar2015novel to randomly insert missing data via the `pop_NA()`
function [@kamvar2015poppr2supp] at rates of 1%, 5%, and 10% each.


### Power Analysis

Permutation analysis of the index of association is commonly used to calculate
statistical support for detecting non-random mating. If the observed value of
$\bar{r}_d$ is greater than 95% of the results from the permutations, then the
null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium is rejected. The power or sensitivity of
this test can be seen as the fraction of significant results within a set of
simulation parameters when the rate of sexual reproduction is < 1.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a statistical method of
assessing the balance between sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic method
[@metz1978basic]. This is done by simultaneously assessing the true positive
fraction of tests to a false positive fraction along a gradient of thresholds of
increasing leniency. A simple way of thinking about ROC analysis is to imagine
two factories that both make marbles. On average, factory A makes marbles half
the size of factory B. Both factories manufacture for the same distributor,
which mixes the marbles from both factories. You are tasked with finding the
best sieve that can accurately and precisely separate the marbles. To measure
this quantity, you order a set of orange marbles from factory A and a set of
blue marbles from factory B. To calculate the ROC curve, you would take a range
of sieves and stack them such that the one with the largest mesh size is on top
and the one with the smallest mesh size is on the bottom and pour both orange
and blue marbles through. The fractions of orange and blue marbles that passed
through each sieve are the true positive and false positive fractions,
respectively. Plot the true positive fraction against the false positive
fraction for each sieve respectively, and you can assess how well the sieve
method works by examining the shape of the ROC curve.

A useful summary of the ROC curve is to calculate the area under the ROC curve
(AURC). Briefly, if a method has perfect explanatory power, the area under the
ROC curve will be equal to 1. If a method has no explanatory power, the AURC
will be equal to 0.5. We used this method to assess the efficacy of $\bar{r}_d$
to detect non-random mating.

To calculate the ROC curve, we first define what a positive value is. If we
consider the p-value of $\bar{r}_d$ as a classifier to determine clonality, we
can define the false positive fraction as the fraction of observations where $p
\leq \alpha$ for simulations where the rate of sexual reproduction is set to 1.0
(Table \@ref(tab:simtab1)). In contrast, the true positive fraction is the
fraction of observations where $p \leq \alpha$ in simulations where clonality is
introduced (e.g. all simulations where the rate of sexual reproduction is less
than 1.0).
 
 Reproductive Mode   $p \leq \alpha$   $p > \alpha$
------------------- ----------------- ---------------
 Non-Random Mating    True Positive    False Negative
   Random Mating     False Positive     True Negative

Table: (\#tab:simtab1) Definitions of false positive and true positive values
for ROC analysis of simulations. *p* is the p-value for $\bar{r}_d$, $\alpha$ is
a threshold value in [0, 1]. Randomly mating populations are simulated with a
sex rate of 1. Non-Random mating populations are simulated with a sex rate less
than one.

We constructed each ROC curve by plotting the true positive fraction on the y
axis and the false positive fraction on the x axis with values of $\alpha$ in
increments of 0.01 from 0 to 1. Curves were calculated hierarchically by rate of
sexual reproduction (< 1) and a unique seed was used to generate the
populations. For each hierarchical level, separate curves were calculated for
sample size, mutation rate, and clone-correction. The areas under the ROC curves
(AURC) were calculated using the `auc()` function in the R package *flux*
version 0.3-0 [@jurasinski2014flux].

Because simulations across rates of sexual reproduction were generated from
unique seeds, we additionally constructed ROC curves for each seed with respect
to clone-correction, sample size, and mutation rate. To test for significant 
effects of clone-correction, sample size, and mutation rate on the inference of 
non-random mating on microsatellite data, we then separated the data by rate of
sexual reproduction and performed a three way (type III) ANOVA on each rate
separately with formula \@ref(eq:anova). For SNP data, we did not have clone
correction or mutation rate differences, so we set these variables to 1. 

\begin{equation}
AURC \sim Clone Correction \times Sample Size \times Mutation Rate (\#eq:anova)
\end{equation}

Because of a pattern that we saw in the results of $E_{5A}$ for microsatellite
data, we asked whether or not using a value of $E_{5A} \geq 0.85$ could help
detect clonal reproduction even if the p-value was non-significant. To assess
this, we conducted an additional ROC analysis to condition p-values on $E_{5A}$ 
such that non-significant values that also had $E_{5A} \geq 0.85$ would be 
considered significant.

## Results

### Clone Correction Negatively Impacts Clonal Inference

For microsatellite data, the values of $\bar{r}_d$ for completely clonal and
nearly clonal populations ranged from -0.577 to 1 in completely clonal data sets
(Fig. \@ref(fig:sim1)). Genotypic diversity statistics (Fig. \@ref(fig:simdiv),
top six panels) showed a predictable pattern of genotypic diversity increasing
with sexual reproduction with diversity being higher on average for clonal
populations with uneven mutation rates as compared to even mutation rates.
Allelic diversity statistics (Fig. \@ref(fig:simdiv), bottom four panels) showed
few differences in means due to mutation rate, but $E_{5A}$ showed consistent
differences in rate of sexual reproduction and sample size. Both $E_{5A}$ and
$H_{exp}$ showed higher values for populations where the rate of sexual
reproduction is < 0.1%. Not shown in the graph is a bimodal pattern in the
$H_{exp}$ distributions with a rate of sexual reproduction < 0.1%.

The power (p <= 0.01) to detect non-random mating decreases significantly at low
levels of sexual reproduction (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim4)). This is further affected
by both mutation rate, sample size, and clone correction. Clone correction,
however, appears to affect even mutation rates more strongly than uneven
mutation rates. For all scenarios the power to detect non-random mating drops to
below 0.25 with rates of sexual reproduction greater than 1%. This trend is only
moderately improved when the threshold is raised to p <= 0.05 (data not shown).
There is less power to detect non-random mating at 0% and 0.01% sex as compared
to 0.05% and 0.1% sex. This appears to be due to the observed negative values of
$\bar{r}_d$ that result in a p-value of 1. At p <= 0.01, we observe a false
positive rate of 1.5% in the worst case scenario.

The ROC and AURC analyses showed a steady decrease in the ability to detect non-
random mating with increasing levels of sexual reproduction, mainly due to a
loss in sensitivity with increasing levels of $\alpha$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:simroc),
\@ref(fig:sim2)). As seen in the power analysis (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim4)), clone
correction consistently appears to lower the power to detect linkage based on
the AURC. For all scenarios, the diagnostic power of $\bar{r}_d$ to detect 
non-random mating is no better than random at rates of sexual reproduction
greater than 10%.

A three-way ANOVA adds support for the hypothesis that clone correction
significantly affects the diagnostic power of $\bar{r}_d$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim3),
Table \@ref(tab:sim3)). While there are no significant effects at 50% sex, clone
correction, mutation rate, and sample size all have a significant effect on
$\bar{r}_d$'s diagnostic properties. At low levels of sex (< 1%), the
interaction of clone correction and mutation rate shows a significant effect,
which is not seen in the interaction of clone correction and sample size. Only
at sex rates of 0.1% and 0.05% do we see significant effects across all
interactions.

Table: (\#tab:sim3) ANOVA table comparing the model $AURC \sim Clone Correction 
\times Sample Size \times Mutation Rate$ for each rate of sexual reproduction
separately. Columns: sexrate = rate of sexual reproduction, term = ANOVA term,
sumsq = sum of squares, df = degrees of freedom, statistic = F statistic,
p.value = p-value, Terms are as follows: CC = Clone Correction, SS = Sample
Size, MR = Mutation Rate.



### Negative Values of $\bar{r}_d$ in Clonal Populations Correlated With Low Allelic Diversity

When using the criterion of $E_{5A} \geq 0.85$ to augment the criteria for the 
ROC analysis, we found that the power to detect non-random mating increased
significantly whereas the false positive rate appeared to only increase with
low sample sizes (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim4a), \@ref(fig:sim2a)). Analyzing the
distributions of the AURC with ANOVA, we found that the most consistently
significant effect found was that of sample size (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim3a), Tab.
\@ref(tab:sim4)) (albeit much like Fig. \@ref(fig:sim3), all effects and
interactions were significant for 0.1% and 0.05% sex).

### Power To Detect Clonal Reproduction in SNP Data

Because of the computational intensity of the simulations, we were only able to
run 24 unique seeds over all rates of sexual reproduction with 10 replicates per
seed. Due to an unexpected corner condition, some replicates failed to save, so
we randomly sampled five replicates per seed per rate of sexual reproduction,
giving us a total of 1,200 total populations for analysis.

Analysis of $\bar{r}_d$ for SNP data showed a similar pattern to the
microsatellite data where clonal and nearly clonal (0.1% sexual reproduction)
distributions of $\bar{r}_d$ were bimodal, but they did not have as many
significantly negative values (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim5)). We observed that that none
of the values of $\bar{r}_d$ for the sexual population reached zero. Increasing
levels of missing data appeared to consistently decrease the value of
$\bar{r}_d$ (\@ref(fig:simmisssnp)). This effect was magnified when missing data
was treated as a new allele.

We initially randomized all loci independently to test for significant
departures from random mating. Our results from that analysis showed *p = 0.001*
for all but two clonal data sets (data not shown). After shuffling each
chromosome independently, we obtained significance values that better reflected
our observations from the microsatellite data. Because of the dearth of
significantly negative $\bar{r}_d$ values in clonal populations, the power of
the index to detect clonal reproduction was greater, but at the cost of an
increase in false positive rates (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim6)). An ANOVA analysis of
the distributions of ROC over the 24 seeds showed significant differences for
0.5% to 10% sexual reproduction (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim7), Tab. \@ref(tab:sim5)).

### Common Features of Microsatellite and SNP Markers

For both microsatellite and SNP data, as found in @de2004clonal, large variances
were observed with extremely low levels of sexual reproduction (Figs.
\@ref(fig:sim1), \@ref(fig:sim5)). The variances and means of $\bar{r}_d$ 
decrease with increasing levels of sexual reproduction. For low levels of sexual
reproduction (< 0.01%), the distributions appeared bimodal. This feature appears
in both the microsatellite and SNP data, but with microsatellite data, the lower
part of the distribution extends into the negative values of $\bar{r}_d$,
resulting in non-significant p-values, which occur when low allelic diversity is
observed. Additionally, with larger sample sizes, the variances decrease (Fig.
\@ref(fig:sim1), \@ref(fig:sim5)) and the power to detect clonal reproduction
increases (\@ref(fig:sim4a), \@ref(fig:sim6)), suggesting that the behavior of
the index is affected by sample size. Based on the power analysis, we observe
that the critical point to detect clonal reproduction in a population is at a
maximum of 1% sexual reproduction (Fig.\@ref(fig:sim4), \@ref(fig:sim4a), 
\@ref(fig:sim6)). 

## Discussion

Scientists have used the index of association to provide evidence for clonal
reproduction in populations. The index of association measure the ratio of
variance between observed and expected genetic distance and is a measure of
linkage among markers (equation \@ref(eq:ia) ) [@brown1980multilocus;
@smith1993how]. @Agapow_2001 created a standardized version, $\bar{r}_d$, that
resembles a correlation coefficient (equation \@ref(eq:rd)). De Meeûx & Balloux
[-@de2004clonal] previously showed that very little sexual reproduction is
required for $\bar{r}_d$ to reach values close to zero (e.g. the absence of
linkage among markers). We confirmed that the power to detect clonal
reproduction is greatly diminished after $\sim$ 1% sex in a population. We also
provide novel insights into how $\bar{r}_d$ responds to marker type, sample
size, mutation rate homogeneity, and clone-correction. We found that the power
to detect significant departures of $\bar{r}_d$ from expected under random
mating decreases with small sample sizes, and thus also decreases with 
clone-correction as sample size is by definition reduced when clone-correcting.
More importantly, we found that linkage depends critically on allelic diversity
at low levels of sexual reproduction (< 0.1%) as discussed below.

### Clone Correction Increases False Negatives

While the presence of over-represented genotypes is often an indication of
clonal reproduction, it does not explicitly rule out sexual reproduction
[@smith1993how; @tibayrenc1996towards; @taylor1999evolutionary]. This can happen
in an 'epidemic' population structure where there is a sudden expansion of one
genotype in an otherwise panmictic population [@smith1993how]. Thus, a common
recommendation to researchers is to conduct analyses on both clone-corrected and
uncorrected data with the expectation that this will reveal any underlying
recombination [@smith1993how; @mcdonald1997population;
@milgroom1996recombination]. When analyzing $\bar{r}_d$, common wisdom says that
if the result is significant with and without clone-correction, then there is
strong evidence for clonal reproduction. This technique was used by Goss et al.
to support the hypothesis that South American populations of the potato late
blight pathogen, *Phytophthora infestans* were reproducing clonally
[-@goss2014irish]. Our findings show that a non-significant value does not
necessarily indicate the absence of clonal reproduction since the power to
detect clonal reproduction consistently decreases with clone-correction(Fig.
\@ref(fig:sim2), \@ref(fig:sim2a)). Our results confirm the concerns raised in
@tibayrenc1996towards of the increase of false negatives due to clone-
correction, further highlighting the fact that a failure to reject the null
hypothesis of random mating does not necessarily mean that the population is
randomly mating [@smith1993how; @tibayrenc1996towards;
@milgroom1996recombination]. Clone-correction thus should be interpreted
carefully in light of the fact that clone-correction reduces sample size and
power is significantly reduced with small sample sizes.

### Mutation Rates and $\bar{r}_d$ 

We assessed the effect of uneven mutation rates across loci, because we had
observed that a single, hyper-variable locus with 18 alleles was the driver for
most of the diversity observed in a previous study on the population dynamics of
*Phytophthora ramorum* in Curry County, OR (@kamvar2015spatial, Supplementary
Table S4). We hypothesized that the high variability would reduce linkage and
thus, reduce the power of $\bar{r}_d$ to detect clonal reproduction. In
contrast, we observed the opposite result; the power to detect clonal
reproduction increased with the presence of a single, hyper-variable locus (Fig.
\@ref(fig:sim4), \@ref(fig:simroc)). This also appears to make the effects of
clone-correction less severe. We believe that this is most likely due to the
observed increase in genotypic diversity, which causes an increased sample size
with clone-correction (Fig. \@ref(fig:simdiv)).

### Allelic Diversity Influences the value of $\bar{r}_d$ in Clonal Populations

A novel feature, not previously observed in @de2004clonal, was the observation
of negative values of $\bar{r}_d$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim1)). While positive values
of $\bar{r}_d$ are easy to interpret (the observed variance is greater than
expected, suggesting non-random mating), negative values are often simply
considered to be evidence for random mating. Significantly (p = 1) negative
values of $\bar{r}_d$ have been observed for pathogens that are well studied and
known to be clonal such as the sudden oak death pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*
(@kamvar2015spatial, Supplementary Table S3) and the wheat stripe rust pathogen
*Puccinia graminis* f.sp. *tritici* (Les Szabo, pers. comm.). A common pattern
in all of these populations is that they all had values of $E_{5A}$ > 0.9 and,
on average, fewer than 4 alleles per locus. This pattern of $E_{5A}$ is
reflected in our simulations (Fig. \@ref(fig:simdiv)). When we set a boundary
condition for our power analysis based on evenness $\{p \leq \alpha \mid E_{5A}
\geq 0.85\}$, we found that this reduced the number of false negatives without
significantly contributing to the number of false positives (Fig.
\@ref(fig:sim4a), \@ref(fig:sim2a)). Levels of $E_{5A} > 0.85$ also had a low
number of allelic states (data not shown), which indicates that the bimodal
distribution of $\bar{r}_d$ for clonal populations is driven by allelic
diversity. Thus, including allelic evenness can serve as a diagnostic parameter
when interpreting linkage at low levels of sexual reproduction under conditions
of low allelic diversity.

### Linkage in SNP Data Increases $\bar{r}_d$ Unilaterally

The results we obtained from SNP data revealed almost no values of $\bar{r}_d$
at or below zero (Fig. \@ref(fig:sim5)). Testing for significance by shuffling
data at each locus independently rendered all the values of $\bar{r}_d$
significant, regardless of rate of sexual reproduction. Only when we shuffled
linkage groups were we able to obtain the same level of significance as compared
to the microsatellite data. This indicates that it is possible to detect clonal
reproduction with the same power as microsatellite markers even with physically
linked markers. Great care, however must be taken to ensure that linkage blocks
are shuffled together or that SNP markers are not linked before assessing
significance of a value of $\bar{r}_d$. In contrast to the microsatellite data,
sample size did not significantly affect power with high levels of clonal
reproduction (Fig \@ref(fig:sim7), Tab: \@ref(tab:sim5)). 

### Limitations of This Study

The scope of simulation studies are limited to the parameters used to generate
the simulations. We do not know, for example, what effect selection, population
subdivision, or polyploidy would have on inference of $\bar{r}_d$. While we were
able to directly compare our populations with even and uneven mutation rates,
because they both represent the exact same populations, we do not know if the
effect we see is due to a higher average mutation rate, thus further study is
needed to detect the effect of mutation rate in clonal populations. In contrast
to @de2004clonal, whereas their simulations had 99 alleles per locus, our
simulations were designed with a small number of alleles per locus to better
reflect microsatellite markers that would be selected for typical population
genetic analyses. Because of this, there was a higher chance of homoplasy in our
simulations. This, however was most likely beneficial to our analysis as our
results show that low allelic diversity can lead to negative $\bar{r}_d$ values,
which we have previously observed in data from purely clonal organisms.

### Conclusions

The index of association is a valuable measure for lending support to the
hypothesis of clonal reproduction in natural populations. We confirm that
$\bar{r}_d$ can provide evidence for clonal reproduction when there is < 1%
sexual reproduction within the population [@de2004clonal], but conclude that
this inference is dependent on sample size and allelic diversity. Thus
scientists should exercise caution when interpreting results from a 
clone-corrected data set. We found that this index is robust enough to detect
the same level of clonal reproduction for SNP data, but results from permutation
analyses may be misleading if linkage is present among markers.

# [Tentative Title] The Effect of Population Dynamics, Sample Size, and Marker Choice on the Index of Association

## Abstract

TBD...

## Introduction

<!-- ZHIAN

 Thinking about different topics to address here. 

 -->

 - Population Genetics of partially clonal organisms
 	- This has been studied in the past [@smith1993how; @balloux2003population;
 	  @de2004clonal; @orive1993effective]
 	- The index of association [@brown1980multilocus; @smith1993how;
 	  @Agapow_2001]
 	- In @de2004clonal, it was shown that $\bar{r}_d$ has a high variance in
 	  clonal populations and @smith1993how showed that it's affected by
 	  population structure.
 - Methods for assessing level of clonal reproduction (CloNcaSe)
   [@ali2016cloncase]
 	- This only works for populations with discrete generations with an
 	  observable sexual stage.
 - Limitations of previous studies
 	- No HTS markers
 	- Significance tests are routinely performed via permutation analysis, but
 	  could not be performed due to software limitations [@burt1996molecular;
 	  @de2004clonal]
 - Objectives
 	1. Analyze mixtures of clonal populations to assess effect of sampling
 	   multiple clonal populations
 	2. Re-analyze rates of sexual reproduction to confirm previous study
 	3. Assess significance tests for $\bar{r}_d$


## Methods

All simulations were performed with the python package simuPOP version 1.1.7 in
python version 3.4. For each scenario, 100 simulations with 10 replicates were
created with a census size of 10,000 individuals evolved over 10,000
generations. From each replicate, 10, 25, 50, and 100 individuals were sampled
without replacement for downstream analysis.

### Microsatellite Simulation

Each population was simulated with 20 co-dominant loci containing 6 to 10
alleles with frequencies drawn from a uniform distribution and normalized.
Before mating, mutations occurred at each locus at a rate of 1e-5
mutations/generation.


### Microsatellite Analysis

The standardized index of association ($\bar{r}_d$) was calculated in R version
3.2 with the package *poppr* version 2.2.1 using the function `ia()` within
custom scripts (supplementary information). Tests for significance were
performed by randomly permuting the alleles at each locus independently and then
assessing $\bar{r}_d$. This was done 999 times for each replicate population.
The p-values reflect the proportion of observations greater than the observed
statistic.


### GBS Simulations

Simulations of 10,000 binary loci at intervals of 1 Mbp over 100 chromosomal
fragments were simulated with a mutation rate of 1e-5 mutations per generation
and a recombination rate of 1e-5 for sexually recombining populations.

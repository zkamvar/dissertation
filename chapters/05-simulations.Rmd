# [Tentative Title] The Effect of Population Dynamics, Sample Size, and Marker Choice on the Index of Association

## Abstract

TBD...

## Introduction

## Methods

All simulations were performed with the python package simuPOP version 1.1.4 in
python version 3.4

### Microsatellite Simulation

For each scenario, 100 simulations with 10 replicates were created. Each
replicate started with 10,000 individuals over 20 co-dominant loci containing 6
to 10 alleles with frequencies drawn from a uniform distribution and normalized.
Each population was evolved over 10,000 generations for each scenario. Before
mating, mutations occurred at each locus at a rate of 1e-5 mutations/generation.
From each replicate, 10, 25, 50, and 100 individuals were sampled without
replacement for downstream analysis.

### Microsatellite Analysis

The standardized index of association ($\bar{r}_d$) was calculated in R version
3.2 with the package *poppr* version 2.2.1 using the function `ia()` within
custom scripts (supplementary information).

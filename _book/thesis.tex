  The genus \emph{Phytophthora}, translating to ``plant destroyer'' in

  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kroon2012genus}{2012}), many of which have
  significant impact on US agriculture. \emph{P. sojae} is a major problem
  on soybean, causing \$1-2 billion in losses each year (Tyler
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-tyler2007phytophthora}{2007}). \emph{P. ramorum}
  is changing the landscape of the North American West due to its wide
  host range (Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008phytophthora}{2008}\protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008phytophthora}{a}),
  which results in devastating losses for the US forestry and nursery
  industries. And \emph{P. infestans}, which was a root cause of over a
  million deaths during the Irish Potato Famine and continues to be a
  problem on tomato and potato crops, resulting in losses exceeding \$6
  billion, annually (Haas \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-haas2009genome}{2009}). \emph{Phytophthora spp.}
  are water molds characterized by production of oospores and biflagellate
  zoospores that place them into the Stramenopiles (Baldauf
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-baldauf2003deep}{2003}). They are most closely
  related to golden brown algae and quite diverged from fungi.

  \section{Abstract}\label{abstract}
  
  Many microbial, fungal, or oomcyete populations violate assumptions for
  population genetic analysis because these populations are clonal,
  admixed, partially clonal, and/or sexual. Furthermore, few tools exist
  that are specifically designed for analyzing data from clonal
  populations, making analysis difficult and haphazard. We developed the R
  package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed,
  clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used
  for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be
  imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and
  can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited
  levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions
  include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites,
  batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of
  genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap
  support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic
  diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations,
  several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any
  populations. A manual with documentation and examples is provided. Poppr
  is open source and major releases are available on CRAN:
  \url{http://cran.r-project.org/package=poppr}. More supporting
  documentation and tutorials can be found under `resources' at:

  \section{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}
  
  To gain a detailed understanding of how plant microbes evolve and adapt
  to hosts, pesticides, and other factors, knowledge of the population
  dynamics and evolutionary history of populations is crucial. Plant
  pathogen populations are often clonal or partially clonal which requires
  different analytical tools. With the advent of high throughput
  sequencing technologies, obtaining genome-wide population genetic data
  has become easier than ever before. We previously contributed the R
  package \emph{poppr} specifically addressing issues with analysis of
  clonal populations. In this paper we provide several significant
  extensions to \emph{poppr} with a focus on large, genome-wide SNP data.
  Specifically, we provide several new functionalities including the new
  function \texttt{mlg.filter} to define clone boundaries allowing for
  inspection and definition of what is a clonal lineage, minimum spanning
  networks with reticulation, a sliding-window analysis of the index of
  association, modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance, and analyses
  across any level of hierarchies.
  
  \section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}
  
  To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in the field of plant-microbe
  interactions makes sense except in the light of population genetics
  (Dobzhansky \protect\hyperlink{ref-dobzhansky2013nothing}{1973}).
  Genetic forces such as selection and drift act on alleles in a
  population. Thus, a true understanding of how plant pathogens emerge,
  evolve and adapt to crops, fungicides, or other factors, can only be
  elucidated in the context of population level phenomena given the
  demographic history of populations (Milgroom \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1989population}{1989}; McDonald \& Linde
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Mcdonald2002}{2002}; Grünwald \& Goss
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2011evolution}{2011}). The field of
  population genetics, in the era of whole genome resequencing, provides
  unprecedented power to describe the evolutionary history and population
  processes that drive coevolution between pathogens and hosts. This
  powerful field thus critically enables effective deployment of R genes,
  design of pathogen informed plant resistance breeding programs, and
  implementation of fungicide rotations that minimize emergence of
  resistance.
  
  Most computational tools for population genetics are based on concepts
  developed for sexual model organisms. Populations that reproduce
  clonally or are polyploid are thus difficult to characterize using
  classical population genetic tools because theoretical assumptions
  underlying the theory are violated. Yet, many plant pathogen populations
  are at least partially clonal if not completely clonal (Anderson \& Kohn
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson1995clonality}{1995}; Milgroom
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1996recombination}{1996}). Thus,
  development of tools for analysis of clonal or polyploid populations is
  needed.
  
  Genotyping by sequencing and whole genome resequencing provide the
  unprecedented ability to identify thousands of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) in populations (Luikart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-luikart2003power}{2003}; Davey \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-davey2011genome}{2011}; Elshire \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-elshire2011robust}{2011}). With traditional
  marker data (e.g., SSR, AFLP) a clone was typically defined as a unique
  multilocus genotype (MLG) (Falush \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Falush01082003}{2003}; Taylor \& Fisher
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-taylor2003fungal}{2003}; Grünwald \& Hoheisel
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2006hierarchical}{2006}; Goss \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2009population}{2009}; Cooke \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-cooke2012genome}{2012}). Availability of
  large SNP data sets provides new challenges for data analysis. These
  data are based on reduced representation libraries and high throughput
  sequencing with moderate sequencing depth which invariably results in
  substantial missing data, error in SNP calling due to sequencing error,
  lack of read depth or other sources of spurious allele calls
  (Mastretta-Yanes \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mastretta2015restriction}{2015}). It is thus not
  clear what a clone is in large SNP data sets and novel tools are
  required for definition of clone boundaries.
  
  The research community using the R statistical and computing language (R
  Core Team \protect\hyperlink{ref-R}{2015}) has developed a plethora of
  new resources for population genetic analysis. R is particularly
  appealing because all code is open source and functions can be evaluated
  and modified by any user. Recently, we introduced the R package
  \emph{poppr} specifically developed for analysis of clonal populations
  (Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  \emph{Poppr} previously introduced several novel features including the
  ability to conduct a hierarchical analysis across unlimited hierarchies,
  test for linkage association, graph minimum spanning networks or provide
  bootstrap support for Bruvo's distance in resulting trees. \emph{Poppr}
  has been rapidly adopted and applied to a range of studies including for
  example horizontal transmission in leukemia of clams (Metzger \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-metzger2015horizontal}{2015}), study of the
  vector-mediated parent-to-offspring transmission in an avian
  malaria-like parasite (Chakarov \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-chakarov2015apparent}{2015}), and
  characterization of the emergence of the invasive forest pathogen
  \emph{Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus} (Gross \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-gross2014population}{2014}). It has also been
  used to implement real-time, online R based tools for visualizing
  relationships among unknown MLGs in reference databases\\
  (\url{http://phytophthora-id.org/}) (Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2011phytophthora}{2011}).
  
  Here, we introduce \emph{poppr} 2.0, which provides a major update to
  \emph{poppr} (Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b})
  including novel tools for analysis of clonal populations specifically
  addressing large SNP data. Significant novel tools include functions for
  calculating clone boundaries and collapsing individuals into clonal
  groups based on a user-specified genetic distance threshold, sliding
  window analyses, genotype accumulation curves, reticulations in minimum
  spanning networks, and bootstrapping for any genetic distance.
  
  \section{Implementations and
  Examples}\label{implementations-and-examples}
  
  \subsection{Clonal identification}\label{clonal-identification}
  
  As highlighted in previous work, clone correction is an important
  component of population genetic analysis of organisms that are known to
  reproduce asexually (Milgroom
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1996recombination}{1996}; Grünwald
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2003analysis}{2003}; Kamvar
  \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  This method is a partial correction for bias that affects metrics that
  rely on allele frequencies assuming panmixia and was initially designed
  for data with only a handful of markers. With the advent of large-scale
  sequencing and reduced- representation libraries, it has become easier
  to sequence tens of thousands of markers from hundreds of individuals
  (Davey \& Blaxter \protect\hyperlink{ref-davey2010rad}{2010}; Davey
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-davey2011genome}{2011}; Elshire
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-elshire2011robust}{2011}). With
  this larger number of markers, the genetic resolution is much greater,
  but the chance of genotyping error is also greatly increased and missing
  data is frequent (Mastretta-Yanes \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mastretta2015restriction}{2015}). Taking this
  fact and occasional somatic mutations into account, it would be
  impossible to separate true clones from independent individuals by just
  comparing what MLGs are different. We introduce a new method for
  collapsing unique multilocus genotypes determined by naive string
  comparison into multilocus lineages utilizing any genetic distance given
  three different clustering algorithms: farthest neighbor, nearest
  neighbor, and UPGMA (average neighbor) (Sokal
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-sokal1958statistical}{1958}).
  
  These clustering algorithms act on a distance matrix that is either
  provided by the user or generated via a function that will calculate a
  distance from genetic data such as \texttt{bruvo.dist}, which in
  particular applies to any level of ploidy (Bruvo \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-bruvo2004simple}{2004}). All algorithms have been
  implemented in C and utilize the OpenMP framework for optional parallel
  processing (Dagum \& Menon
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-dagum1998openmp}{1998}). Default is the
  conservative farthest neighbor algorithm (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure1}A),
  which will only cluster samples together if all samples in the cluster
  are at a distance less than the given threshold. By contrast, the
  nearest neighbor algorithm will have a chaining effect that will cluster
  samples akin to adding links on a chain where a sample can be included
  in a cluster if all of the samples have at least one connection below a
  given threshold (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure1}C). The UPGMA, or average
  neighbor clustering algorithm is the one most familiar to biologists as
  it is often used to generate ultra-metric trees based on genetic
  distance (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure1}B). This algorithm will cluster by
  creating a representative sample per cluster and joining clusters if
  these representative samples are closer than the given threshold.

  (\textbf{C}) Nearest neighbor clustering clusters all nodes together

  \end{figure}
  
  We utilize data from the microbe \emph{Phytophthora infestans} to show
  how the \texttt{mlg.filter} function collapses multilocus genotypes with
  Bruvo's distance assuming a genome addition model (Bruvo \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-bruvo2004simple}{2004}). \emph{P. infestans} is
  the causal agent of potato late blight originating from Mexico that
  spread to Europe in the mid 19th century (Yoshida \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-yoshida2013rise}{2013}; Goss \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2014irish}{2014}). \emph{P. infestans}
  reproduces both clonally and sexually. The clonal lineages of \emph{P.
  infestans} have been formally defined into 18 separate clonal lineages
  using a combination of various molecular methods including AFLP and
  microsatellite markers (Lees \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-lees2006novel}{2006}; Li \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-li2013efficient}{2013}). For these data, we used
  \texttt{mlg.filter} to detect all of the distance thresholds at which 18
  multilocus lineages would be resolved. We used these thresholds to
  define multilocus lineages and create contingency tables and dendrograms
  to determine how well the multilocus lineages were detected.
  
  For the \emph{P. infestans} population, the three algorithms were able
  to detect 18 multilocus lineages at different distance thresholds (Fig.
  \ref{fig:Figure-2}). Contingency tables between the described multilocus
  genotypes and the genotypes defined by distance show that most of the 18
  lineages were resolved, except for US-8, which is polytomic (Table
  \ref{pinftable}).

  We utilized simulated data to evaluate the effect of sequencing error
  and missing data on MLG calling. We constructed the data using the
  \texttt{glSim} function in \emph{adegenet} (Jombart \& Ahmed
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2011adegenet}{2011}) to obtain a SNP data
  set for demonstration. Two diploid data sets were created, each with 10k
  SNPs (25\% structured into two groups) and 200 samples with 10 ancestral
  populations of even sizes. Clones were created in one data set by
  marking each sample with a unique identifier and then randomly sampling
  with replacement. It is well documented that reduced- representation
  sequencing can introduce several erroneous calls and missing data
  (Mastretta-Yanes \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mastretta2015restriction}{2015}). To reflect
  this, we mutated SNPs at a rate of 10\% and inserted an average of 10\%
  missing data for each sample after clones were created, ensuring that no
  two sequences were alike. The number of mutations and missing data per
  sample were determined by sampling from a Poisson distribution with
  \(\lambda = 1000\). After pooling, 20\% of the data set was randomly
  sampled for analysis. Genetic distance was obtained with the function
  \texttt{bitwise.dist}, which calculates the fraction of different sites
  between samples equivalent to Provesti's distance, counting missing data
  as equivalent in comparison (Prevosti \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prevosti1975distances}{1975}).
  
  All three filtering algorithms were run with a threshold of 1, returning
  a numeric vector of length \(n - 1\) where each element represented a
  threshold at which two samples/clusters would join. Since each data set
  would have varying distances between samples, the clonal boundary
  threshold was defined as the midpoint of the largest gap between two
  thresholds that collapsed less than 50\% of the data.
  
  Out of the 100 simulations run, we found that across all methods,
  detection of duplicated samples had \(\sim\) 98\% true positive fraction
  and \(\sim\) 0.8\% false positive fraction indicating that this method
  is robust to simulated populations (supplementary materials\footnote{Supplementary

  \subsection{Minimum Spanning Networks with
  Reticulation}\label{minimum-spanning-networks-with-reticulation}
  
  In its original iteration, \emph{poppr} introduced minimum spanning
  networks that were based on the \emph{igraph} function
  \texttt{minimum.spanning.tree} (Csardi \& Nepusz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-csardi2006igraph}{2006}). This algorithm produces
  a minimum spanning tree with no reticulations where nodes represent
  individual MLGs. In other minimum spanning network programs,
  reticulation is obtained by calculating the minimum spanning tree
  several times and returning the set of all edges included in the trees.
  Due to the way \emph{igraph} has implemented Prim's algorithm, it is not
  possible to utilize this strategy, thus we implemented an internal C
  function to walk the space of minimum spanning trees based on genetic
  distance to connect groups of nodes with edges of equal weight.
  
  To demonstrate the utility of minimum spanning networks with
  reticulation, we used two clonal data sets: the H3N2 flu virus data from
  the \emph{adegenet} package using years of each epidemic as the
  population factor, and \emph{Phytophthora ramorum} data from Nurseries
  and Oregon forests (Jombart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}; Kamvar \emph{et
  al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014sudden}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014sudden}{a}).
  Minimum spanning networks were created with and without reticulation
  using the \emph{poppr} functions \texttt{diss.dist} and
  \texttt{bruvo.msn} for the H3N2 and \emph{P. ramorum} data, respectively
  (Bruvo \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-bruvo2004simple}{2004};
  Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  To detect mlg clusters, the infoMAP community detection algorithm was
  applied with 10,000 trials as implemented in the R package \emph{igraph}
  version 0.7.1 utilizing genetic distance as edge weights and number of
  samples in each MLG as vertex weights (Csardi \& Nepusz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-csardi2006igraph}{2006}; Rosvall \& Bergstrom
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-rosvall2008maps}{2008}).
  
  To evaluate the results, we compared the number, size, and entropy
  (\(H\)) of the resulting communities as we expect a highly clonal
  organism with low genetic diversity to result in a few, large
  communities. We also created contingency tables of the community
  assignments with the defined populations and used those to calculate
  entropy using Shannon's index with the function \texttt{diversity} from
  the R package \emph{vegan} version 2.2-1 (Shannon
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-shannon2001mathematical}{2001}; Oksanen \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-oksanen2015vegan}{2015}). A low entropy
  indicates presence of a few large communities whereas high entropy
  indicates presence of many small communities.
  
  The infoMAP algorithm revealed 63 communities with a maximum community
  size of 77 and \(H = 3.56\) for the reticulate network of the H3N2 data
  and 117 communities with a maximum community size of 26 and \(H = 4.65\)
  for the minimum spanning tree. The entropy across years was greatly
  decreased for all populations with the reticulate network compared to
  the minimum spanning tree (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure-3}). Note that the
  reticulated network (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure-3}B) showed patterns
  corresponding with those resulting from a discriminant analysis of
  principal components (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure-3}D) (Jombart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}).

  Graph walking of the reticulated minimum spanning network of \emph{P.

  spanning tree revealed 20 communities with a maximum community size of 7
  and \(H = 2.96\). In the ability to predict Hunter Creek as belonging to
  a single community, the reticulated network was successful whereas the
  minimum spanning tree separated one genotype from that community. The
  entropy for the reticulated network was lower for all populations except
  for the coast population (supplementary materials\footnote{Supplementary

  \subsection{Bootstrapping}\label{bootstrapping}
  
  Assessing population differentiation through methods such as \(G_{st}\),
  AMOVA, and Mantel tests relies on comparing samples within and across
  populations (Mantel \protect\hyperlink{ref-mantel1967detection}{1967};
  Nei \protect\hyperlink{ref-nei1973analysis}{1973}; Excoffier \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-excoffier1992analysis}{1992}). Confidence in
  distance metrics is related to the confidence in the markers to
  accurately represent the diversity of the data. Especially true with
  microsatellite markers, a single hyper-diverse locus can make a
  population appear to have more diversity based on genetic distance.
  Using a bootstrapping procedure of randomly sampling loci with
  replacement when calculating a distance matrix provides support for
  clades in hierarchical clustering.
  
  Data in genind and genpop objects are represented as matrices with
  individuals in rows and alleles in columns (Jombart
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Jombartux5f2008}{2008}). This gives the advantage
  of being able to use R's matrix algebra capabilities to efficiently
  calculate genetic distance. Unfortunately, this also means that
  bootstrapping is a non- trivial task as all alleles at a single locus
  need to be sampled together. To remedy this, we have created an internal
  S4 class called ``bootgen'', which extends the internal ``gen'' class
  from \emph{adegenet}. This class can be created from any genind,
  genclone, or genpop object, and allows loci to be sampled with
  replacement. To further facilitate bootstrapping, a function called
  \texttt{aboot}, which stands for ``any boot'', is introduced that will
  bootstrap any genclone, genind, or genpop object with any genetic
  distance that can be calculated from it.
  
  To demonstrate calculating a dendrogram with bootstrap support, we used
  the \emph{poppr} function \texttt{aboot} on population allelic
  frequencies derived from the data set \texttt{microbov} in the
  \emph{adegenet} package with 1000 bootstrap replicates (Laloë \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-laloe2007consensus}{2007}; Jombart
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Jombartux5f2008}{2008}). The resulting dendrogram
  shows bootstrap support values \(>50\%\) (Fig. \ref{fig:microboot}) and
  used the following code:

  \subsection{Genotype Accumulation
  Curve}\label{genotype-accumulation-curve}
  
  Analysis of population genetics of clonal organisms often borrows from
  ecological methods such as analysis of diversity within populations
  (Milgroom \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1996recombination}{1996};
  Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2003analysis}{2003}; Arnaud-Hanod
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-arnaud2007standardizing}{2007}).
  When choosing markers for analysis, it is important to make sure that
  the observed diversity in your sample will not appreciably increase if
  an additional marker is added (Arnaud-Hanod \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-arnaud2007standardizing}{2007}). This concept is
  analogous to a species accumulation curve, obtained by rarefaction. The
  genotype accumulation curve in \emph{poppr} is implemented in the
  function \texttt{genotype\_curve}. The curve is constructed by randomly
  sampling \(x\) loci and counting the number of observed MLGs. This
  repeated \(r\) times for 1 locus up to \(n-1\) loci, creating \(n-1\)
  distributions of observed MLGs.
  
  The following code example demonstrates the genotype accumulation curve
  for data from Everhart \& Scherm
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-everhart2014fine}{2015}) showing that these data
  reach a small plateau and have a greatly decreased variance with 12
  markers, indicating that there are enough markers such that adding more
  markers to the analysis will not create very many new genotypes (Fig.
  \ref{fig:moniliniacurve}).

  \subsection{Index of association}\label{index-of-association-1}
  
  The index of association (\(I_A\)) is a measure of multilocus linkage
  disequilibrium that is most often used to detect clonal reproduction
  within organisms that have the ability to reproduce via sexual or
  asexual processes (Brown \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-brown1980multilocus}{1980}; Smith \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-smith1993how}{1993}; Milgroom
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1996recombination}{1996}). It was
  standardized in 2001 as \(\bar{r}_d\) by Agapow \& Burt
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Agapowux5f2001}{2001}) to address the issue of
  scaling with increasing number of loci. This metric is typically applied
  to traditional dominant and co-dominant markers such as AFLPs, SNPs, or
  microsatellite markers. With the advent of high throughput sequencing,
  SNP data is now available in a genome-wide context and in very large
  matrices including thousands of SNPs. For this reason, we devised two
  approaches using the index of association for large numbers of markers
  typical for population genomic studies. Both functions utilize
  \emph{adegenet}'s ``genlight'' object class, which efficiently stores 8
  binary alleles in a single byte (Jombart \& Ahmed
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2011adegenet}{2011}). As calculation of
  the \(\bar{r}_d\) requires distance matrices of absolute number of
  differences, we utilize a function that calculates these distances
  directly from the compressed data called \texttt{bitwise.dist}.
  
  The first approach is a sliding window analysis implemented in the
  function \texttt{win.ia}. It utilizes the position of markers in the
  genome to calculate \(\bar{r}_d\) among any number of SNPs found within
  a user-specified windowed region. It is important that this calculation
  utilize \(\bar{r}_d\) as the number of loci will be different within
  each window (Agapow \& Burt
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Agapowux5f2001}{2001}). This approach would be
  suited for a quick calculation of linkage disequilibrium across the
  genome that can detect potential hotspots of LD that could be
  investigated further with more computationally intensive methods
  assuming that the number of samples \textless{}\textless{} the number of
  loci.
  
  As it would necessarily focus on loci within a short section of the
  genome that may or may not be recombining, a sliding window approach
  would not be good for utilizing \(\bar{r}_d\) as a test for clonal
  reproduction. A remedy for this is implemented in the function
  \texttt{samp.ia}, which will randomly sample \(m\) loci, calculate
  \(\bar{r}_d\), and repeat \(r\) times, thus creating a distribution of
  expected values of \(\bar{r}_d\).
  
  To demonstrate the sliding window and random sampling of \(\bar{r}_d\)
  with respect to clonal populations, we simulated two populations
  containing 1,100 neutral SNPs for 100 diploid individuals under the same
  initial seed. One population had individuals randomly sampled with
  replacement, representing the clonal population. After sampling, both
  populations had 5\% random error and 1\% missing data independently
  propagated across all samples. On average, we obtained a higher value of
  \(\bar{r}_d\) for the clonal population compared to the sexual
  population for both methods (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure-6}).

  \subsection{Data format updates: population strata and
  hierarchies}\label{data-format-updates-population-strata-and-hierarchies}
  
  Assessments of population structure through methods such as hierarchical
  \(F_{st}\) (Goudet \protect\hyperlink{ref-goudet2005hierfstat}{2005})
  and AMOVA (Michalakis \& Excoffier
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-michalakis1996generic}{1996}) require
  hierarchical sampling of populations across space or time (Linde
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-linde2002population}{2002};
  Grünwald \& Hoheisel
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2006hierarchical}{2006}; Everhart \&
  Scherm \protect\hyperlink{ref-everhart2014fine}{2015}). With clonal
  organisms, basic practice has been to clone-censor data to avoid
  downward bias in diversity due to duplicated genotypes that may or may
  not represent different samples (Milgroom
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milgroom1996recombination}{1996}). This
  correction should be performed with respect to a population hierarchy to
  accurately reflect the biology of the organism. Traditional data
  structures for population genetic data in most analysis tools allow for
  only one level of hierarchical definition. The investigator thus had to
  provide the data set for analysis at each hierarchical level.
  
  To facilitate handling hierarchical and mutlilocus genotypic metadata,
  \emph{poppr} version 1.1 introduced a new S4 data object called
  ``genclone'', extending \emph{adegenet}'s ``genind'' object (Kamvar and
  Grünwald, unpublished). The genclone object formalized the definitions
  of multilocus genotypes and population hierarchies by adding two slots
  called ``mlg'' and ``hierarchy'' that carried a numeric vector and a
  data frame, respectively. These new slots allow for increased efficiency
  and ease of use by allowing these metadata to travel with the genetic
  data. The hierarchy slot in particular contains a data frame where each
  column represents a separate hierarchical level. This is then used to
  set the population factor of the data by supplying a hierarchical
  formula containing one or more column names of the data frame in the
  hierarchy slot.
  
  The functionality represented by the hierarchy slot has now been
  migrated from the \emph{poppr} to the \emph{adegenet} package version
  2.0 to allow hierarchical analysis in \emph{adegenet}, \emph{poppr}, and
  other dependent packages. The prior \emph{poppr} \texttt{hierarchy} slot
  and methods have now been renamed \texttt{strata} in \emph{adegenet}. A
  short example of the utility of these methods can be seen in the code
  segment under \textbf{Bootstrapping}, above. This migration provides end
  users with a broader ability to analyze data hierarchically in R across
  packages.

  \section{Discussion}\label{discussion}
  
  Given low cost and high throughput of current sequencing technologies we
  are entering a new era of population genetics where large SNP data sets
  with thousands of markers are becoming available for large populations
  in a genome- wide context. This data provides new possibilities and
  challenges for population genetic analyses. We provide novel tools that
  enable analysis of this data in R with a particular emphasis on clonal
  organisms.
  
  Particularly useful is the implementation of \(\bar{r}_d\) in a genomic
  context (Agapow \& Burt \protect\hyperlink{ref-Agapowux5f2001}{2001}).
  Random sampling of loci across the genome can give an expected
  distribution of \(\bar{r}_d\), which is expected to have a mean of zero
  for panmictic populations. This metric is not affected by the number of
  loci sampled, is model free, and has the ability to detect population
  structure. \(\bar{r}_d\) is also implemented for sliding window analyses
  that are useful to detect candidate regions of linkage disequilibrium
  for further analysis.
  
  Clustering multilocus genotypes into multilocus lineages based on
  genetic distances is a non-trivial task given large SNP data sets.
  Moreover, this has not previously been implemented for genomic data for
  clonal populations. Clonal assignment has previously been available in
  the programs \textsc{GenClone} and \textsc{Genodive} for classical
  markers (Meirmans \& Van Tienderen
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-meirmans2004genotype}{2004}; Arnaud-Hanod
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-arnaud2007standardizing}{2007}).
  Our method with \texttt{mlg.filter} builds upon this idea and allows the
  user to choose between three different approaches for clustering MLGs.
  The choice of clustering algorithm has an impact on the data (Fig.
  \ref{fig:Figure1}, \ref{fig:Figure-2}), where for example a genetic
  distance cutoff of 0.1 would be the difference between 14 multilocus
  lineages (MLLs) and 17 MLLs for nearest neighbor and UPGMA clustering,
  respectively (Fig. \ref{fig:Figure-2}). The option to choose the
  clustering algorithm gives the user the ability to choose what is
  biologically relevant to their populations. While there is not one
  optimal procedure for defining boundaries in clonal lineages, our tool
  provides a means of exploring the potential MLG or MLL boundary space.
  
  Minimum spanning networks are a useful tool to analyze the relationships
  between individuals in a population, because it reduces the complexity
  of a distance matrix to the connections that are strongest. By default,
  these networks are drawn without reticulations, but for clonal organisms
  where many of the connections between samples are equivalent, the
  minimum spanning network appears as a chain and reduces the information
  that can be communicated. This is problematic because the ability to
  detect population structure with one instance of a minimum spanning
  network is limited. Adding reticulation into the minimum spanning
  network thus presents all equivalent connections and allows population
  structure to be more readily detectable. As shown in Fig.
  \ref{fig:Figure-3}, population structure is apparent both visually and
  by graph community detection algorithms such as the infoMAP algorithm
  (Rosvall \& Bergstrom \protect\hyperlink{ref-rosvall2008maps}{2008}).
  Additionally, the current implementation in \emph{poppr} has been
  successfully used in analyses such as reconstruction of the \emph{P.
  ramorum} epidemic in Oregon forests (Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014sudden}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014sudden}{a},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015spatial}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015spatial}{c}).
  
  \emph{Poppr} 2.0 is open source and available on GitHub. Members of the
  community are invited to contribute by raising issues or pull requests

  \section{Abstract}\label{abstract-2}
  
  Sudden oak death caused by the oomycete \emph{Phytophthora ramorum} was
  first discovered in California toward the end of the 20th century and
  subsequently emerged on tanoak forests in Oregon before its first
  detection in 2001 by aerial surveys. The Oregon Department of Forestry
  has since monitored the epidemic and sampled symptomatic tanoak trees
  from 2001 to the present. Populations sampled over this period were
  genotyped using microsatellites and studied to infer the population
  genetic history. To date, only the NA1 clonal lineage is established in
  this region, although three lineages exist on the North American west
  coast. The original introduction into the Joe Hall area eventually
  spread to several regions: mostly north but also east and southwest. A
  new introduction into Hunter Creek appears to correspond to a second
  introduction not clustering with the early introduction. Our data are
  best explained by both introductions originating from nursery
  populations in California or Oregon and resulting from two distinct
  introduction events. Continued vigilance and eradication of nursery
  populations of \emph{P. ramorum} are important to avoid further
  emergence and potential introduction of other clonal lineages.
  
  \section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}
  
  Sudden oak death (SOD) emerged as a severe epidemic disease on coast
  live oak (\emph{Quercus agrifolia}) and tanoak (\emph{Notholithocarpus
  densiflorus}) in California in the mid 1990s and reemerged shortly
  thereafter on tanoak in Oregon in the early 2000s (Rizzo \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-rizzo2005phytophthora}{2005}; Hansen \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-hansen2008epidemiology}{2008}; Grünwald
  \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008phytophthora}{2008}\protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008phytophthora}{a};
  Everhart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-everhart2014phytophthora}{2014}). SOD is caused
  by \emph{Phytophthora ramorum} Werres, De Cock \& Man in't Veld, and is
  considered to be one of the top two oomycete pathogens based on its
  scientific and economic importance (Werres \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-werres2001phytophthora}{2001}; Kamoun \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamoun2014top}{2014}). The Oregon epidemic
  was first detected during aerial surveys in 2001 on tanoak but likely
  derived from initial introductions in the late 1990s. The Oregon
  Department of Forestry has since monitored the epidemic and sampled
  symptomatic tanoaks since 2001 (Hansen \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hansen2008epidemiology}{2008}). Strains sampled
  from infected sites in forest or nursery environments have been
  genotyped in several labs using a range of microsatellite loci (Prospero
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2004isolation}{2004},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009}; Ivors \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ivors2006microsatellite}{2006}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009}).
  
  \emph{P. ramorum} has emerged repeatedly around the world as 4 distinct
  clonal lineages found in North America (lineages NA1, NA2, and EU1) and
  Europe (EU1 and EU2) (Ivors \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ivors2006microsatellite}{2006}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2012emergence}{2012}; Poucke
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-vanpoucke2012discovery}{2012}). The
  lineages have been named by the continent on which they first appeared,
  i.e.~North America (= NA) or Europe (= EU) and are numbered in order of
  discovery (Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009}). The NA1 clonal
  lineage was first discovered in California causing SOD on tanoak and
  coast live oak and is the one currently found in Curry County, Oregon,
  USA (Mascheretti \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mascheretti2008reconstruction}{2008}). The EU1
  and NA2 populations were discovered later in nursery environments and
  are currently only found in California, Oregon, Washington and British
  Columbia while the NA1 clone has been shipped with nursery plants from
  the West to the Southern and Southwestern US (Ivors \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ivors2006microsatellite}{2006}; Mascheretti
  \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mascheretti2008reconstruction}{2008}; Prospero
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009}; Goss
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2009population}{2009},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2012emergence}{2012}). The EU1
  clonal lineage is the one first discovered in Europe, but in 2007 the
  new EU2 lineage emerged in Northern Ireland and since migrated to
  Western Scotland (Werres \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-werres2001phytophthora}{2001}; Poucke \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-vanpoucke2012discovery}{2012}). EU1 was
  first introduced to Europe and eventually migrated to the Pacific
  Northwest of North America (Goss \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011}).
  
  \emph{P. ramorum} populations sampled in Oregon forests to date belong
  exclusively to the NA1 clonal lineage (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}; Hansen \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-hansen2008epidemiology}{2008}). Given that
  NA2 and/or EU1 clones have been found in California, Oregon, Washington,
  and/or British Columbia in association with nursery plant movements,
  introduction of NA2 or EU1 from nursery environments to Curry County
  forests is a plausible scenario (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009} p. 2007; Goss
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011} p.
  2009; Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2012emergence}{2012}). Our present work
  thus monitors populations and potential emergence of novel lineages in
  Oregon forests.
  
  Our main objectives here are to describe the spatial and temporal
  pattern of the populations and clonal dynamic of the SOD pathogen in
  Curry County in southwestern Oregon from 2001 to the present.
  Specifically, we asked (1) if novel lineages have been introduced into
  the forests in Curry County, (2) if multiple introductions occurred, and
  (3) whether introduction might have come from nursery populations. We
  sampled infected tanoaks between 2001-2014 and characterized populations
  using microsatellite analysis.
  
  \section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-and-methods}
  
  \subsection{Location}\label{location}
  
  The SOD infested areas are located in the Siskiyou Mountains of Curry
  County in south western Oregon near the town of Brookings
  (42.0575\(^{\circ}\) N, 124.2864\(^{\circ}\) W) on the coast (Figure
  \ref{fig:ramorum1}) (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}). The Siskiyou
  mountains form part of the Klamath Mountain range (Franklin and Dyrness
  1988). The vegetation in SOD infested areas is a mosaic of different
  vegetation types including mixed-evergreen, redwood (\emph{Sequoia
  sempervirens}) and Douglas-fir (\emph{Pseudotsuga menziesii}) forests
  with tanoak as the dominant SOD host.

  abbreviations for regions shown in the map are explained in Table
  \ref{tab:ramorum1}. The inset shows the placement of Curry county (red
  dot) in SW Oregon.}\label{fig:ramorum1}
  \end{figure}
  
  \newpage
  
  \subsection{Sampling}\label{sampling}
  
  Commencing in 2001, 2-4 aerial surveys per year were conducted over the
  tanoak range by the Oregon Department of Forestry and the USDA Forest
  Service in Curry County. The survey detects recently killed tanoaks
  based on the reddish-brown color of foliage (Hansen \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hansen2008epidemiology}{2008}). All trees
  identified by aerial surveys were ground checked and geographically
  referenced using a hand-held GPS instrument (Garmin GPS 12XL or 60CX,
  Garmin International, Olathe, KS). Bark or foliage samples were
  collected for determination of \emph{P. ramorum} presence by culturing
  in the field and laboratory. Host plants within the area of the
  delimitation survey, generally 300 feet, were also inspected and sampled
  if they were symptomatic. Maps of distribution were prepared using
  ArcView GIS version 3.3 and ArcMap version 10.2 (Environmental Systems
  Research Institute, Redlands, CA).

  Isolations were made from symptomatic plant tissue onto selective CARP
  agar (Difco corn meal agar, 10 ppm natamycin, 200pm NA-ampicillin, and
  10 ppm rifampicin) (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}). Candidate
  \emph{Phytophthora} cultures were transferred onto corn meal agar with
  30 ppm \(\beta\)-sitosterol. \emph{P. ramorum} identification was
  confirmed by microscopic inspection for presence of characteristic
  chlamydospores and deciduous sporangia (Werres \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-werres2001phytophthora}{2001}). Genomic DNA was
  extracted using either the FastDNA SPIN kit (MP Biomedicals, LLC;
  116540600) (Goss \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2009population}{2009}) or the cetyltrimethyl
  ammonium bromide (CTAB )-chloroform-isopropanol method (Winton \& Hansen
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-winton2001molecular}{2001}). Table
  \ref{tab:ramorum1} provides an overview of strains collected by year and
  region following regions as shown in figure \ref{fig:ramorum1}.
  
  \subsection{Genotyping, data validation, and
  harmonization}\label{genotyping-data-validation-and-harmonization}
  
  Five microsatellite loci were utilized in this analysis: PrMS6, Pr9C3,
  PrMS39, PrMS45, and PrMS43 (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2004isolation}{2004},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008susceptibility}{2008}\protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2008susceptibility}{b},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009}). Genotyping
  (see specific protocols in supplementary text) of \emph{P. ramorum}
  strains collected 2001-2012 occurred over several years and in several
  laboratories, with different protocols and sequencers. Consequently, a
  concerted effort was made to create a comprehensive dataset with
  identical allele calls. To detect errors, allele calls from all five
  genotyped loci were generated for a subsample of 40 isolates
  representing the most common multilocus genotypes from the culture
  collection, and then compared to data from participating laboratories.
  Three of the five loci, PrMS6, Pr9C3, and PrMS39 had identical allele
  calls between laboratories for the subsampled isolates. The remaining
  two loci, PrMS45 and PrMS43, had allele calls that differed by a single
  bp between laboratories. Data from PrMS45 and PrMS43 were therefore
  corrected to allow consistent comparisons of allele calls. Given the
  varied nature of the genotyping data described above genotyping of
  \emph{P. ramorum} strains consists of two datasets including either 5
  loci (2001-14) or a newly developed, multiplexed method including 14
  loci (samples 2013-14) (Table \ref{tab:ramorum2}). Details on both
  genotyping methods can be found in the supplementary text and figure S1.

  \subsection{Nursery populations}\label{nursery-populations}
  
  To determine if forest populations cluster with different nursery
  populations from Oregon or California, we used previously published data
  from our work to determine relationships among nursery and Curry County
  forest populations (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009}; Goss
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2009population}{2009},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011}).
  
  \subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}
  
  All individuals genotyped for this effort belonged to the NA1 clonal
  lineage (Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009}). Thus, all
  analyses presented here focused on describing the clonal dynamic using
  model-free approaches that avoid violation of population genetic theory.
  Samples were grouped into different multilocus genotypes (MLGs) defined
  by the unique combination of alleles across all observed loci from the
  consensus five SSR loci genotyped across all years. For identification
  purposes, unique MLGs were then assigned an arbitrary number from 1 to
  the total number of observed MLGs. Population genetic analysis was
  conducted using the computer and statistical language R (R Core Team
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-R2014}{2014}) using various packages as well as R
  functions written specifically for this project (see github link below).
  Graphs and figures were created using the R packages \emph{ggplot2, ape,
  igraph, ggmap,} and \emph{poppr} (Paradis \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-paradis2004ape}{2004}; Csardi \& Nepusz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-csardi2006igraph}{2006}; Wickham
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-wickham2009ggplot2}{2009}; Kahle \& Wickham
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-khale2013ggmap}{2013}; Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  Within-locus allelic diversity was analyzed across and within years and
  regions using the function \texttt{locus\_table()} from the R package
  \emph{poppr} (Table S1) (Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  To address the temporal and spatial aspects of the data, populations
  were analyzed both by year isolated and watershed region (Table
  \ref{tab:ramorum1}; Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum1}). Watershed regions were
  drawn with ArcMap version 10.2 (Environmental Systems Research
  Institute, Redlands, CA). The regions represent drainages or portions of
  drainages in which infected trees were discovered as the disease
  progressed over time. In most cases, ridgelines dividing drainages
  formed the boundary of a region. These regions were saved as shapefiles
  and imported into R with \emph{rgdal} (Bivand \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-bivand2014rgdal}{2014}).
  
  Genotypic diversity was analyzed within and across years and
  populations, with the Shannon-Wiener index (\emph{H}) and the Stoddard
  and Taylor's index (\emph{G}), (Stoddart \& Taylor
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-stoddart1988genotypic}{1988}; Shannon
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-shannon2001mathematical}{2001}). Both \emph{G}
  and \emph{H} measure genotypic diversity, combining richness and
  evenness. If all genotypes are equally abundant, then the value of
  \emph{G} will be the number of MLGs and the value of \emph{H} will be
  the natural log of the number of MLGs. Both \emph{G} and \emph{H} are
  used as they weigh more or less abundant MLGs more heavily, respectively
  (Grünwald \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2003analysis}{2003}). Evenness was
  calculated as \emph{E\textsubscript{5}}, which is an estimator of
  evenness that utilizes both \emph{H} and \emph{G} that gives a ratio of
  the number of abundant genotypes to rare genotypes (Pielou
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-pielou1975ecological}{1975}; Ludwig \& Reynolds
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ludwig1988statistical}{1988}; Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2003analysis}{2003}). These were
  calculated with the R packages \emph{poppr} and \emph{vegan} (Oksanen
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-oksanen2013vegan}{2013}; Kamvar
  \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  Confidence intervals were calculated using the R package \emph{boot}
  with 9,999 bootstrap resamplings (Canty \& Ripley
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-canty2015boot}{2015}). Richness, or the expected
  number of MLGs (\emph{eMLG}), was calculated using rarefaction from the
  R packages \emph{poppr} and \emph{vegan} (Hurlbert
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hurlbert1971nonconcept}{1971}; Heck \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-heck1975explicit}{1975}). Some statistics (AMOVA,
  genotypic diversity, index of association, allelic diversity, and Nei's
  distance) were also performed on clone-censored data where each MLG was
  represented once per population hierarchy.
  
  Because the analysis of genotypic diversity, richness and evenness is
  agnostic to specific alleles within MLGs, assessment of genetic
  relatedness between MLGs was performed using the function
  \texttt{bruvo.dist()} using \emph{poppr}, which calculates Bruvo's
  genetic distance, utilizing a stepwise mutation model for microsatellite
  loci (bruvo2004simple; Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  This distance thus gives a more fine-scale picture of relationships
  between individuals than band-sharing models. These relationships were
  visualized with minimum spanning networks generated using the R packages
  \emph{igraph} and \emph{poppr} (Csardi \& Nepusz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-csardi2006igraph}{2006}; Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  
  If the epidemic had a single origin, a correlation between genetic and
  geographic distance would be expected as populations acquire mutations
  over time and clonally diverge regardless of rates of spread. Divergence
  is affected by rates and distance of spread where long-distance
  dispersal or low rates of mutation would lead to less divergence and
  thus lower correlations between genetic and geographic distances. This
  was tested by performing Mantel tests across all hierarchical levels in
  the data set utilizing the function \texttt{mantel.randtest()} in the R
  package \emph{ade4} between Bruvo's distance as described above and
  Euclidean distances between geographic coordinates (Mantel
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mantel1967detection}{1967}; Dray \& Dufour
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-dray2007ade4}{2007}). \emph{P}-values were
  calculated using 99,999 bootstrap replicates.
  
  As the eradication efforts destroy the immediate habitat in an infected
  area, one question that we wanted to address was whether or not
  genotypes were clustering to specific regions or if they were evenly
  spread throughout Curry County (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}). This was tested
  using three methods: bootstrap analysis of Nei's genetic distance,
  Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA), and Discriminant Analysis of
  Principal Components (DAPC) in the R packages \emph{poppr}, \emph{ade4},
  and \emph{adegenet} (Excoffier \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-excoffier1992analysis}{1992}; Jombart \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}; Kamvar
  \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{2014}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2014poppr}{b}).
  The bootstrap analysis utilized 10,000 bootstrap replicates treating
  loci as independent units with the function \texttt{aboot()} in
  \emph{poppr} and was visualized as an unrooted neighbor-joining tree in
  figtree v. 1.4.2 (Figure \ref{fig:ramorum5}). AMOVA utilizes a distance
  matrix between genotypes for which hierarchical partitions are defined
  and attempts to analyze the variation within samples, between samples,
  between subpopulations within populations and finally between
  populations. In this case, we used both the hierarchies of samples
  within years within regions and samples within regions within years.
  DAPC is a multivariate, model-free approach to clustering based on prior
  population information (Jombart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}). This allows us
  to analyze the population structure by assessing how well samples can be
  reassigned into previously defined populations. Both DAPC and AMOVA were
  run with and without Hunter Creek and Pistol River South Fork due to
  isolated genotypes and small sample size, respectively. For the DAPC
  analysis, these removed populations had their origins predicted from the
  DAPC object using the function predict.dapc in the R package
  \emph{adegenet} (Jombart \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}).
  
  Since DAPC is sensitive to the number of principal components used in
  analysis, the function \texttt{xvalDapc()} from the R package
  \emph{adegenet} was used to select the correct number of principal
  components with 1,000 replicates using a training set of 90\% of the
  data. The number of principal components was chosen based on the
  criteria that it had to produce the highest average percent of
  successful reassignment and lowest root mean squared error (Jombart
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-jombart2010discriminant}{2010}).
  Significant deviations from random population structure was tested in
  AMOVA utilizing the function \texttt{randtest()} from the R package
  \emph{ade4} with 9,999 bootstrap replicates (Dray \& Dufour
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-dray2007ade4}{2007}).

  \section{Results}\label{results}
  
  \subsection{Demographic pattern and genetic
  diversity}\label{demographic-pattern-and-genetic-diversity}
  
  The epidemic has expanded over time from the initial focus in Joe Hall
  Creek NE of Brookings, Oregon mostly north (first to N Fork Chetco High)
  and northwest (Coast, Pistol River South Fork), but also east (Chetco
  Main and Winchuck) (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum1}; Table \ref{tab:ramorum1}).
  To date a total of 70 multilocus genotypes have been found in forest
  populations (Table \ref{tab:ramorum1}). MLG 22 is most abundant and the
  only MLG detected across the whole period (although it was not sampled
  in every year) (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum2}). MLG 59, the second most
  abundant MLG, was only detected in 2011 and has a high frequency due to
  the sampling design applied: all 2011 strains were sampled in one
  concentrated area in the northwestern sampling range geographically
  distant from any other location (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum2}). Given that
  sampling strategies for some years were not comprehensive, samples from
  some years have to be interpreted with caution (e.g., 2005-6, 2010-11).
  Samples from 2013 and 2014 are sampled from all regions and can be
  considered more representative.

  Allelic and genotype diversity within loci revealed that PrMS43 had, on
  average, the highest number of alleles (n = 18). All other loci had 5 or
  fewer alleles with a moderate to high amount of diversity (Table S2).
  Nevertheless, the genotype accumulation curve showed a slight plateau,
  indicating that we have enough power in our data to describe a
  significant number of MLGs (Fig. S2). Genotypic diversity (\emph{H} =
  2.98, \emph{G} = 8.64), evenness (\emph{E\textsubscript{5}} = 0.41), and
  richness (\emph{eMLG} = 7) were low as expected for a clonal population
  slowly accumulating mutations over space and time (Table S3). A pattern
  of increasing diversity across years (with number of MLGs not fewer than
  10) was also observed (Table S3). The minimum spanning network showed
  that MLGs 17, 22, and 28 clustered in the center of the network and had
  the highest number of connections to other genotypes in the forest
  populations (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum3}). Most genotypes were connected to
  their immediate neighbors by a genetic distance of 0.05 or the
  equivalent of one mutational step across 5 diploid loci.

  overlap. Edges (lines) represent minimum genetic distance between
  individuals determined by Prim's algorithm. Nodes that are more closely
  related will have darker and thicker edges whereas nodes more distantly
  related will have lighter and thinner edges or no edge at all.
  Reticulation was introduced by finding exact ties in genetic distance
  after Prim's algorithm was run. Subgroups of \textgreater{}3 MLGs where
  all nodes are no more than one mutational step (d = 0.05) away from its
  neighbors, are highlighted in arbitrary colors.}\label{fig:ramorum3}
  \end{figure}
  
  \newpage
  
  \subsection{Spatial Correlation}\label{spatial-correlation}
  
  A Mantel test revealed significant correlations of genetic distance and
  geographic distance for most samples collected after 2003 (Table
  \ref{tab:ramorum3}). When partitioned by year, this correlation appears
  to increase and become more pronounced with the progression of the
  epidemic. When partitioned by region, those that are closer to the
  origin of the epidemic (Joe Hall Creek and N Fork Chetco River) show
  significant correlation. When the overall mantel test was run without
  Hunter Creek, the correlation coefficient was reduced (0.175), but was
  still significant (\emph{p} = 0.0001).

  \subsection{Population
  differentiation}\label{population-differentiation}
  
  Cluster analysis of populations with respect to year using Nei's genetic
  distance showed no significant (\textgreater{}70\%) bootstrap support
  for any clades, but does show that these tend to cluster by region as
  opposed to year (Fig. S3). AMOVA analysis revealed significant
  population structure between regions on both clone-corrected (with
  respect to hierarchy) and uncorrected data sets (Table
  \ref{tab:ramtab4}). Significant structure was only found between years
  within regions on the uncorrected data set. Both patterns were observed
  without Hunter Creek and Pistol River South Fork isolates. DAPC
  clustering showed that the first discriminant component separated Hunter
  Creek from all other regions and the second discriminant component shows
  a gradient from Joe Hall Creek to the coast (Fig. \ref{fig:ramfig4}).
  This distinction was reflected in the percent of correct posterior
  assignment of isolates to their original populations. Over the whole
  data set there was an 81.5\% assignment-success rate. Hunter Creek
  received 100\% successful reassignment. Joe Hall Creek, Winchuck, and
  Coast all had \textgreater{}85\% successful reassignment whereas Chetco
  Main, North Fork of the Chetco, and Pistol River South Fork all had
  \textless{}69\% successful reassignment (Fig. S4). The isolation of the
  Hunter Creek isolates in the DAPC analysis was found to be mainly driven
  by allele 493 at locus PrMS43 (Fig. S5). The only other population to
  share this allele was Joe Hall Creek where it was present in a total of
  4 isolates, and only isolates found in the coastal region or North Fork
  Chetco contained the allele 489, which is one mutational step away in a
  stepwise mutation model of a tetranucleotide repeat locus. When DAPC was
  run without Hunter Creek and Pistol River South Fork data, percent
  successful reassignment for all regions did not change significantly.
  Prediction of sources for the Hunter Creek data revealed that over 98\%
  of the genotypes were assigned to the Coast with a 99\% probability.

  \subsection{Clustering of forest with nursery
  populations}\label{clustering-of-forest-with-nursery-populations}
  
  We used previously published data to determine if nursery populations in
  California or Oregon could have been source populations for the Oregon
  forest epidemic (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009}, Prospero \emph{et
  al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007}); Grünwald
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2009standardizing}{2009};
  Goss \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011} p.
  2009). Nursery data included 40 MLGs across 216 samples of NA1 clones.
  Of these 40, 12 MLGs matched the forest sample and 28 MLGs were unique
  to the nurseries. The only region that did not contain genotypes that
  matched those found in nurseries was Pistol River South Fork. When
  considering those 12 genotypes that were present in both data sets, with
  the exception of Joe Hall Creek, all genotypes were first isolated from
  nurseries before discovery in the forest. At the most variable locus,
  PrMS43, both nursery populations had the allele 281 at frequencies of
  4.5\% and 4.9\% for CA and OR, respectively. This allele was not
  observed in the forest population. Both populations contained allele 489
  at \textgreater{}10\% frequency and the CA nursery population contained
  allele 493 at a frequency of 1.4\%.
  
  When nursery genotypes were added to the minimum spanning network, MLGs
  found at Hunter Creek, previously isolated in the network, connected by
  only a single MLG from the coast, gained more connections to nursery
  MLGs. Clustering with Nei's distance revealed the Nursery isolates from
  CA consistently clustering closest with Hunter Creek isolates in both
  clone-corrected and uncorrected data sets (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum5}).
  DAPC clustering revealed a decrease in overall assignment-success rate
  at 78\%. The nursery isolates received 74\% and 83\% assignment success
  for CA and OR nurseries, respectively.

  nursery data changed less than 5\% for all regions except for the coast,
  which saw a decrease of 17.6\% when nursery populations were included
  (Fig. S4). Prediction of sources for nursery genotypes against the
  forest data revealed that 48\% of these nursery isolates were predicted
  to share membership with the coast at \(\geq\) 95\% probability (Fig.
  S6, S7). A total of 3.2\% of the isolates were predicted to share
  membership with Hunter Creek at \(\geq\) 99.9\% membership probability.
  Furthermore, 21.75\% of the nursery data could not be assigned to any of
  the forest populations at \textgreater{} 60\% probability.
  
  Since 3.2\% of the nursery isolates had a very strong signal for Hunter
  Creek, we predicted sources for Hunter Creek isolates when considering
  nursery isolates. This approach determines if Hunter Creek isolates
  cluster more readily with nursery or coast populations. Indeed, 92\% of
  the Hunter Creek isolates were predicted to share membership with
  California nurseries at \(\geq\) 99\% membership probability (Fig. S8).
  No Hunter Creek isolate was predicted to share membership with a forest
  population at \textgreater{}0.45\% membership probability.
  
  \section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}
  
  To date populations monitored from 2001-14 show presence of only the NA1
  clonal lineage observed previously (Prospero \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2007population}{2007},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prospero2009migration}{2009}). The fact that
  individuals belonging to the EU1 and NA2 clonal lineages have not been
  found in Oregon forests, despite their presence on the west coast from
  British Columbia to California is welcome news (Goss \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2009population}{2009}, Goss \emph{et al.}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-goss2011phytophthora}{2011}); Grünwald \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2012emergence}{2012}). The lack of
  EU1 or NA2 isolates provides evidence that monitoring for \emph{P.
  ramorum} in nurseries by federal and state agencies is helping avoid
  emergence of new clones in Oregon's Forests.
  
  Our analysis provides support for a most parsimonious scenario of two
  introductions into Curry county from nurseries: one initial introduction
  into Curry County sometime before detection of the first infected
  tanoaks in 2001 from California (or less likely Oregon) nurseries
  followed by a second introduction into the Hunter Creek area again from
  nurseries. The relative position of the nursery populations in the
  minimum spanning network and DAPC scatter plot (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum3},
  \ref{fig:ramfig4}) suggest that the introductions from nurseries were
  rare, though more even sampling and migration models could disprove this
  hypothesis. Since 2001, the epidemic has spread clonally throughout
  Southwestern Curry County mostly north, but also west, towards the
  coast, and southeast. This clonal spread of the pathogen from the Joe
  Hall area is supported partially by Mantel tests showing significant
  levels of isolation by distance in years following 2002 (Table
  \ref{tab:ramorum3}) along with significant AMOVA results across regions
  (Table \ref{tab:ramtab4}). The populations sampled in 2011 in Hunter
  Creek (Cape Sebastian) appear to have originated from a new source and
  cluster into a distinct group based on DAPC (Fig. \ref{fig:ramfig4}).
  Based on the minimum spanning network, this population would appear
  isolated in the epidemic if it were not for MLG 32, which is connected
  with MLG 33 (found on the coast in 2010) by one mutational step at locus
  PrMS43. This, in turn, is connected with the other MLGs from Hunter
  Creek by one mutational step at locus PrMS39. When considering
  clustering via Bruvo's distance in combination with data from nursery
  populations, however, these genotypes from Hunter Creek appear to be
  more similar to California nursery populations (Fig. \ref{fig:ramorum3})
  than Oregon forest populations. Predictions based on DAPC place samples
  from Hunter Creek as coming from California nurseries (Fig. S8). This,
  in combination with the observation that purely forest genotypes
  (i.e.~those only found in the forest) are connected to Hunter Creek
  genotypes through nursery genotypes, indicates a possible contribution
  from nursery populations to the epidemic. This is supported by the
  observation that all population level clustering, with and without clone
  correction, places the Hunter Creek isolates adjacent to the nursery
  isolates from CA (Fig. \ref{fig:ramfig4}, \ref{fig:ramorum5}). This
  appears to be driven by the high frequency of allele 246 at locus
  PrMS39, which interestingly appears to segregate in an east to west
  fashion and is increasing in frequency over time (Fig. S9, S10). This,
  along with the results from the DAPC clustering and subsequent
  prediction (Fig. S6, S7) provide weak support for a potential third
  introduction into the coastal region from nurseries sometime after the
  Hunter Creek introduction event.
  
  An interesting aspect is the observation that there appeared to be more
  than one cluster of genotypes introduced into the Joe Hall area during
  the early stages of the epidemic. The two dominant clusters that
  appeared were the ones that contained MLG 22 and MLG 68. The former has
  been found in the most recent sampling year, whereas the latter has not
  been observed since 2005 or beyond the Joe Hall area. This latter group
  was also the most distantly related group overall, more distant than
  some nursery genotypes. While it is clear that the eradication effort
  has not been entirely successful, there is some evidence that it is
  having an effect as a major genotype cluster has effectively been
  eradicated, although disappearance of MLGs could also be explained by
  being less fit than lineages dominating now.
  
  The Curry County epidemic is in many ways different from the epidemic in
  California. When introduced into California in the mid 1990's, the
  causal agent of sudden oak death was unknown and thus gave it time to
  clonally expand and diversify as management strategies in natural forest
  systems were limited (Rizzo \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-rizzo2002phytophthora}{2002}). With the foresight
  of the epidemic in central California, the ODF was able to implement a
  quarantine effort against the import of hosts as soon as the causal
  agent was known (A Kanaskie, pers. comm.). This quarantine along with
  aggressive eradication efforts have affected the spread of \emph{P.
  ramorum} (Mascheretti \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mascheretti2008reconstruction}{2008}). Drawing
  conclusions from previous population studies in California and applying
  them to the Oregon epidemic should be undertaken with great care given
  the drastically differing management scenarios (Mascheretti \emph{et
  al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-mascheretti2008reconstruction}{2008},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mascheretti2009genetic}{2009}).
  
  Our work has some inherent drawbacks. Given the cost of aerial surveys
  and subsequent ground crew work, and the fact that trees are eradicated
  once found, populations are not hierarchically sampled across all years.
  The destructive nature of the management approach means that it was not
  possible to conduct controlled ecological experiments focusing on
  effects of climate and rainfall on the spread of disease as was possible
  in California trials (Eyre \emph{et al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eyre2013poulation}{2013}). In addition, most of
  our work only used 5 microsatellite loci for genotyping. Ideally, more
  loci should have been used as was done in other studies (Croucher
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-croucher2013combining}{2013}).
  Although only 5 loci were used, clear patterns of population dynamics in
  space and time emerged and the MLG accumulation curve supported the fact
  that loci are informative. Finally, the populations genotyped here are
  clonal and belong to the NA1 clonal lineage. Thus, much of the
  analytical power provided by population genetic theory does not apply
  given that basic assumptions would be violated (Grünwald \& Goss
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-grunwald2011evolution}{2011}). Our work uses
  appropriate methods to infer patterns that are model free, yet
  informative such as spatial clustering. Thus, we believe that this work
  provides novel and important insights into the \emph{P. ramorum}
  population biology in the Siskiyou forest. Our data indicates that there
  might have been at least two introductions into Oregon forests from
  nurseries. The nature of the data does not allow inference of
  directional migrations given the uneven sampling strategy and moderate
  number of loci used across all years. We are currently exploring
  genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) as a method that could provide further
  detail on how these populations evolved over space and time (Elshire
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-elshire2011robust}{2011}). GBS can
  provide richer detail by providing codominant SNP data across several
  thousand loci sampling the whole genome.

  \section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}
  
  \emph{Phytophthora syringae} is the most important species affecting
  ornamentals produced in the Pacific Northwest. Recent nursery sampling
  efforts, aimed at characterizing the diversity of \emph{Phytophthoras}
  within Oregon nurseries, have revealed the species \emph{P. syringae} to
  be among the most abundant taxa found in the nurseries surveyed (Parke
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-parke2014phytophthora}{2014}).
  \emph{P. syringae} is adapted to cold weather and grows best in the
  cool, wet fall, winter and spring and is least active in summer (Erwin
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-erwin1996phytophthora}{1996}). Like
  \emph{P. ramorum}, it has a wide host range including
  \emph{Rhododendron}, \emph{Camellia}, \emph{Malus}, and many other taxa.
  It has the capability for outcrossing, self-fertilizing, and reproducing
  clonally. This pathogen has been found globally since 1881 and is
  problematic on woody ornamentals such as crabapple (\emph{Malus spp.}),
  as it causes unsightly cankers that make the plant unsellable (Erwin
  \emph{et al.} \protect\hyperlink{ref-erwin1996phytophthora}{1996}).
  While the ecology of this pathogen has been studied to some degree, very
  little is known about the demographic history and population structure
  on a local and global scale.

  \section{Methods}\label{methods}
  
  Initial sets of simulations were created for different levels of sexual
  reproduction for each marker type. All simulations were performed with
  the python package simuPOP version 1.1.7 in python version 3.4. For each
  scenario, 100 simulations with 10 replicates were created with a census
  size of 10,000 diploid individuals with equal mating type proportions
  evolved over 10,000 generations. From each replicate, 10, 25, 50, and
  100 individuals were sampled without replacement for downstream analysis
  in R version 3.2 with the package \emph{poppr} version 2.2.1 on full and
  clone-corrected data sets. All downstream analyses were run on the OSU
  CGRB Core Computing Facility (supplementary information).
  
  \subsection{Simulating Microsatellite
  Loci}\label{simulating-microsatellite-loci}
  
  Each population was simulated with 20 co-dominant, unlinked loci
  containing 6 to 10 alleles per locus with frequencies drawn from a
  uniform distribution and subsequently normalized. Before mating,
  mutations occurred at each locus at a rate of 1e-5 mutations/generation
  in a stepwise manner using the \texttt{StepwiseMutator()} operator.
  
  \subsection{GBS Simulations}\label{gbs-simulations}
  
  Simulations of 10,000 binary loci at spread evenly over 10 chromosomal
  fragments were simulated with a mutation rate of 1e-5 mutations per
  generation for forward and backward mutations using the
  \texttt{SNPMutator()} operator and and a recombination rate of 1e-5
  between adjacent loci using the \texttt{Recombinator()} operator.
  
  \subsection{Sexual Reproduction}\label{sexual-reproduction}
  
  Simulations of sexual reproduction were analyzed at 10 rates of sexual
  reproduction on a log scale (0.0, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-2, 5e-2,
  0.1, 0.5, 1.0) reflecting the fraction of individuals in generation
  \emph{t+1} produced via sexual reproduction. One to three offspring
  could be produced at each mating event. For sexual events, two parents
  were chosen randomly from the population with the
  \texttt{RandomSelection()} operator and offspring genotypes were created
  via the \texttt{MendelianGenoTransmitter()} operator. The clonal
  fraction was created by randomly sampling individuals from the
  population and duplicating their genotypes with the
  \texttt{CloneGenoTransmitter()} operator. If one mating type was lost
  before 10,000 generations, the simulation would continue to completion
  with only clonal reproduction.
  
  \subsection{Analysis of Microsatellite
  Data}\label{analysis-of-microsatellite-data}
  
  The standardized index of association (\(\bar{r}_d\)) was calculated for
  full and clone-corrected data using the \emph{poppr} function
  \texttt{ia()}. Tests for significance were performed by randomly
  permuting the alleles at each locus independently and then assessing
  \(\bar{r}_d\). This was done 999 times for each replicate population.
  Re-sampling was not performed with clone-corrected data. The p-values
  reflect the proportion of observations greater than the observed
  statistic. Estimates of genotypic diversity were assessed with the
  \emph{poppr} function \texttt{diversity\_boot()} with 999 bootstrap
  replicates, recording the estimate and variance.
  
  \subsection{Analysis of SNP Data}\label{analysis-of-snp-data}
  
  Because GBS data are associated with high error rates, we additionally
  wanted to assess the effect of error and missing data on analysis. To do
  this, we used scripts written for Kamvar \emph{et al.}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015novel}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015novel}{b})
  to randomly insert missing data (via the \texttt{pop\_NA()} function)
  and genotyping errors (via the \texttt{pop\_mutator()}) (Kamvar \emph{et
  al.}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015poppr2supp}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-kamvar2015poppr2supp}{a})
  at rates of 5\% and 10\% each. We then used the \emph{poppr} function
  \texttt{mlg.filter()} to with the farthest neighbor algorithm to
  collapse multilocus genotypes with 5\% and 10\% similarity and compared
  the results with the known genotypes. Genotypic diversity was assessed
  with the \emph{poppr} function \texttt{diversity\_boot()} with 999
  bootstrap replicates on the filtered data sets, recording the variance.
  
  The overall value of \(\bar{r}_d\) was calculated for each simulation
  with the \emph{poppr} function \texttt{bitwise.ia()}. To assess
  within-chromosome dynamics, values of \(\bar{r}_d\) were calculated
  along chromosomes using the \emph{poppr} function \texttt{win.ia()}
  along windows of 50 and 100 SNPs. Cross-chromosome dynamics of
  \(\bar{r}_d\) were assessed by utilizing random samples of 50, 100, and
  1000 SNPs replicated 999 times for each population sample.
  
  \subsection{Power Analysis}\label{power-analysis}
  
  The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a method of
  assessing the explanatory power of a method by assessing the true
  positive fraction of tests to a false positive fraction (Metz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-metz1978basic}{1978}). Briefly, if a method has
  perfect explanatory power, the area under the ROC curve will be equal to
  1. If a method has no explanatory power, the area under the ROC curve
  will be equal to 0.5. ROC analysis was carried as described in Metz
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-metz1978basic}{1978}) as a comparison of the
  false positive fraction to the true positive fraction as you increase
  the level of rejection, (\(\alpha\)). The null hypothesis for the ROC
  analysis was defined where the rate of sexual reproduction was 100\%.
  All other rates were considered to be separate alternative hypotheses.
  The curves were calculated by analyzing the data sets over increasing
  values of \(\alpha\) from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.01. The area under
  the ROC curves was calculated using the \texttt{trapz()} function in the
  R package \emph{pracma} version 1.9.5 (Borchers
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-borchers2016pracma}{2016}). ANOVA was run with
  the following models:

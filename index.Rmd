# Introduction

The objectives of my work were two-fold and included 1. development of
computational tools to characterize populations and 2. application of these
tools to populations of the plant pathogen *Phytophthora*.

## What is population genetics

## Need for tools for population genetics

Clonal pathogens are a special case ...

In the past need to reformat files for each program and use of a plethora of
programs

The R plafrorm

The need for poppr

Ia

Educational tools

## Introduction to _Phytophthora_

What is the genus _Phytophthora_.

_P. ramorum_

_P. syringae_

## Conclusions

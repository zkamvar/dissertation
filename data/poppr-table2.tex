\caption{Summary table shown as it would appear in the R console produced by the \texttt{poppr()} function with 999 permutations to calculate $I_A$ and $\bar{r}_d$ p-values from the \texttt{Aeut} data set in \textit{poppr} from [@Grunwald:2003]. \texttt{N}: census size, \texttt{MLG}: multilocus genotypes, \texttt{eMLG}: expected MLG based on rarefaction, \texttt{SE}: standard error from rarefaction, \texttt{H}: Shannon-Wiener Index, \texttt{G}: Stoddart and Taylor's Index, \texttt{Hexp}: Nei 1978 Expected Heterozygosity, \texttt{E.5}: Evenness ($E_5$), \texttt{Ia}: $I_A$, \texttt{p.Ia}: p-value for $I_A$, \texttt{rbarD}: $\bar{r}_d$, \texttt{p.rD}: p-value for $\bar{r}_d$. Table was obtained with the following code: \texttt{library(poppr); data(Aeut); poppr(Aeut, sample = 999)}.}

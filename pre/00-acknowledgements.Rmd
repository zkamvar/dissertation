I must first acknowledge my funding for my Ph. D.: US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Grant 5358-22000-039-00D, USDA
APHIS, the USDA-ARS Floriculture Nursery Initiative, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture/Oregon Association of Nurseries (ODA-OAN), the USDA-Forest
Service Forest Health Monitoring Program, the Department of Botany and Plant
Pathology for providing me with two terms of valuable teaching experience, as
well as a generous travel grant from the Anita Summers foundataion. The Oregon
State University Graduate School provided me with a $500 travel grant and
NESCent provided me with airfare to attend the Population Genetics in R
Hackathon in Charlotte, NC, which helped me get in contact with developers of
*adegenet*, which helped immeasurably to the improvement of *poppr* and Chapter
3. Finally, I must acknowledge the Botany and Plant Pathology Graduate Student
Association and the American Phytopathological Society Foundation for providing
me with funding to attend the 2016 APS Annual Meeting in Tampa, FL.


A Ph. D. student is nothing without the support of her/his community. For this
support, I am ever grateful for the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology for
providing me with a home for the past 5 years. I must thank my advisor, Niklaus
J. Gr√ºnwald for providing me with the tools and challenges necessary for me to
succeed. My committee members, Gail Langellotto, Chris Mundt, Michael Blouin,
and Joey Spatafora for their immense patience and understanding whenever I came
to them stuck in a well of my own thoughts.

I need to thank Robin Choudhury for taking time to be a sounding board for the 
structure of the introduction and conclusion of this dissertation.

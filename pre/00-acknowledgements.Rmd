I must first acknowledge my funding for my Ph. D.: US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Grant 5358-22000-039-00D, USDA
APHIS, the USDA-ARS Floriculture Nursery Initiative, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture/Oregon Association of Nurseries (ODA-OAN), the USDA-Forest
Service Forest Health Monitoring Program, the Department of Botany and Plant
Pathology for providing me with two terms of valuable teaching experience, as
well as a generous travel grant from the Anita Summers foundataion. The Oregon
State University Graduate School provided me with a $500 travel grant and
NESCent provided me with airfare to attend the Population Genetics in R
Hackathon in Charlotte, NC, which helped me get in contact with developers of
*adegenet*, which helped immeasurably to the improvement of *poppr* and Chapter
3. Finally, I must acknowledge the Botany and Plant Pathology Graduate Student
Association and the American Phytopathological Society Foundation for providing
me with funding to attend the 2016 APS Annual Meeting in Tampa, FL.


A Ph. D. student is nothing without the support of her/his community. For this
support, I am ever grateful for the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and
the USDA ARS Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory for providing me with a
home for the past 5 years. I must thank my advisor, Niklaus J. Grünwald for
providing me with the tools and challenges necessary for me to succeed. I thank
my committee members, Gail Langellotto, Chris Mundt, Michael Blouin, and Joey
Spatafora for their immense patience and understanding whenever I came to them
stuck in a well of my own thoughts. I am ever grateful to Jeff Chang, Jerry 
Wieland, and Walt Mahaffee for long and winding conversations on the nature of
graduate school and science. The Hansen lab graciously hosted me and my 
*Phytophthora* samples during the October 2013 government shutdown. Paul Reeser,
Wendy Sutton, Laura Sims, and Everett Hanson taught me a lot about the biology
of *Phytophthora syringae*. I also would like to thank Val Fieland, Meg Larsen,
Caroline Press, and Karan Fairchild for teaching me to culture *Phytophthora*, 
and keeping the Grünwald lab running smoothly despite my best efforts to
introduce chaos. I could not have made it through graduate school without the
patience and support of Sydney E. Everhart and Brian J. Knaus, who were always
willing to sit down and talk about everything from population genetic theory to
writing style to life in general.

I need to thank Robin Choudhury, Brian Knaus, and Danielle Tom, for taking time
to be sounding boards for the structure of the introduction and conclusion of
this dissertation.

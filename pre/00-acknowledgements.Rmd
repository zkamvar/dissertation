A Ph. D. student is nothing without the support of her/his community. For this
support, I am ever grateful for the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and
the USDA ARS Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory for providing me with a
home for the past 5 years. I must thank my advisor, Niklaus J. Grünwald for
providing me with the tools and challenges necessary for me to succeed. I thank
my committee members, Gail Langellotto, Chris Mundt, Michael Blouin, and Joey
Spatafora for their immense patience and understanding whenever I came to them
stuck in a well of my own thoughts. I am ever grateful to Joyce Loper, Brenda
Shaffer, Jeff Chang, Jerry Weiland, and Walt Mahaffee for long and winding
conversations on the nature of graduate school and science. The Hansen lab
graciously hosted me and my *Phytophthora* samples during the October 2013
government shutdown. Paul Reeser, Wendy Sutton, Sarah Navarro, Laura Sims, and
Everett Hansen taught me a lot about the biology of *Phytophthora*. I also would
like to thank Val Fieland, Meg Larsen, Caroline Press, and Karan Fairchild for
teaching me to culture *Phytophthora*, and keeping the Grünwald lab running
smoothly despite my best efforts to introduce chaos. I also wish to thank Dianne
Simpson, Carleen Nutt, and Blaine Baker for providing a sanctuary of sarcastic
jokes and for keeping BPP together. I also want to thank my wonderful
undergraduate mentees, Ciera Gray and Jonah Brooks. It was a wonderful
opportunity to get to see both of you grow and apply your skills.


I could not have made it through graduate school without the patience and
support of Sydney E. Everhart and Brian J. Knaus, who were always willing to sit
down and talk about everything from population genetic theory, writing style, to
life in general. These two were responsible for guiding me through much of the
research and writing before it ever went to my advisor. Most importantly, Sydney
and Brian gave me encouragement even if I was being down on myself.


I must also thank all the graduate students for being such a strong community
for all of us to debate, celebrate, and commiserate. I especially need to thank
(in no particular order) M. Quamar Salih, J. Caity Smyth, Hank Raizen, Sarah
Navarro, Joey Hulbert, Top Jimmy Klick, Lorena Rangel, Rachel Bomberger, Lindsey
Thiessen, Javier F. Tabima R., Alija Bajro Mujic (word), Christina Hagerty,
Hannah Rivedal, Kat Sweeny, Kevin Weitemier, Trang Dang, Danielle Tom, Shankar
"Shanks" Shakya, Zach S.L. Foster, Alisha Owensby Quandt, Chris Hedstrom, Dani
Lightle, Derek Johnson, Thomas Stokely, Tyler Schappe (for endless Simpsons
quotes), Kristen Finch, Brian Atkinson, Phil Schapker, Mara Friddle, Jeremy
Hoffman, Braden Elliot, Biz Stamm, Chris Benemann, Daniel Henry Farber, John
Yeo, Alfredo Diaz, Pat DiBello, Megan O'Malley, Gray Rozabach, Nash Irongay, Sam
Colby, Lea Condon, Dabao Lu, and Pat Bennett. All of these people and more have
contributed to my well being in one way or another and I can't possibly thank
them enough for it. I also need to thank everyone at the Coalition of Graduate
Employees who taught me the strength of community, especially, but not limited
to, Ashley Bromley, (K)Sean McGregor, Béatrice Moissinac, Kris Osterloh, Chris
Mihiar, Stephanie Parreira, Thomas Morrill, Vance Almquist, Clint Mattox, and
Dixie Daniels.


Special thanks goes to Joseph Michael Hulbert. Together with his drive and
ambition, we created the radio show Inspiration Dissemination which has to date
interviewed over 150 graduate students from Oregon State University. This show
has provided a valuable outlet for me and it would not be possible without the
undying dedication from Joey. In turn, I would like to thank Matthew Spence
McConnell for not only picking up the torch from Joey, but also for continuing
to improve the show and attract a wider range of graduate students to be
featured. I am additionally thankful for the hosts who will take the show to a
glorious future, Kristen Finch, Adrian Gallo, Steve Friedman, Mackenzie Smith,
and Lillie Padgitt-Cobb. I want to thank all of the guests who have come on the
show and told your stories. Lastly, I need to thank all of the people at KBVR
who have supported the show throughout the years, especially: Kurt Hagan, Jodie
Davaz, Matt Walton, Rose Kearsey, Anthony Heatherly, and Jack Kemp. Radio has
always been an escape for me and I'm thankful for the people who helped me be a
part of it. 


For many, the writing of the introduction and conclusion to a dissertation is
one of the most difficult tasks. I want to thank Robin Choudhury, Brian Knaus,
Danielle Tom, and Nik Grünwald for taking time to be sounding boards for the
structure of the introduction and conclusion of this dissertation.


Finally, I need to thank my family for their enduring patience; my mother, Jane
H. Kamvar, my sister Margo Cartwright, and my brother Rostam Kamvar. The most
thanks must of course go to my wonderful spouse, Jimin Im Kamvar. Without her, 
my life would have no color or balance. She was the only one who could keep me
going when all seemed hopeless. 



I must additionally acknowledge my funding for my Ph. D.: US Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service Grant 5358-22000-039-00D, USDA
APHIS, the USDA-ARS Floriculture Nursery Initiative, the Oregon Department of
Agriculture/Oregon Association of Nurseries (ODA-OAN), the USDA-Forest
Service Forest Health Monitoring Program, the Department of Botany and Plant
Pathology for providing me with two terms of valuable teaching experience, as
well as a generous travel grant from the Anita Summers foundataion. The Oregon
State University Graduate School provided me with a $500 travel grant and
NESCent provided me with airfare to attend the Population Genetics in R
Hackathon in Charlotte, NC. This helped me get in contact with Thibaut Jombart,
the maintainer of *adegenet*, allowing me to contribute significant
improvements, which helped immeasurably to the improvement of *poppr* and
Chapter 3. Finally, I must acknowledge the Botany and Plant Pathology Graduate
Student Association and the American Phytopathological Society Foundation for
providing me with funding to attend the 2016 APS Annual Meeting in Tampa, FL.

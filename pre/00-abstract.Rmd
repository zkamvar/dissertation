Research on the population genetics of microbial organisms requires the use of
specialized analyses designed for clonal organisms to avoid violating the
assumptions of traditional population genetic models. The tools necessary for
performing these analyses existed as a set of unrelated software with 
non-overlapping capabilities and did not cover all aspects of analysis. This
meant that researchers not only had to reshape their data into different formats
for each analysis, but they also had to switch computing platforms, not only
creating a drain in time, but also increasing the risk of propagating human
error into the analysis. To address this problem, we created the software
package *poppr*, written in the R statistical language, available on all
computing platforms. This package is designed for analysis of clonal, partially
clonal, and sexual populations, empowering researchers to perform their work in
a reproducible manner. We additionally demonstrate the utility of *poppr* for
both plant pathological and theoretical questions by using real-world and
simulated data. In chapter 4, we apply these new tools to demonstrate evidence
for at least two origins for the outbreak of the Sudden Oak Death pathogen,
*Phytophthora ramorum* in Curry County, Oregon. In chapter 5, we use *poppr* to
assess the power of the index of association with clone-correction, showing that
clone-correction has the potential to reduce the power of detecting clonal
reproduction. All of the software and analyses in this work were performed in an
open and reproducible framework, serving as an example of the power of
reproducible research in plant pathology.
